Here are some ideas for future chapters.
These chapters will not be added to the released [SmartPoop 1.0](README.md) in December 2021.
The goal is rather to add them for a future SmartPoop 2.0.

- Human trafficking (between Chapters 5 and 6 of SmartPoop 1.0) : SmartPoop is used by prostitution and pedophilia organizations, to certify the "quality" of prostitutes against sexually transmitted diseases. When SmartPoop is made aware of the case, Katia decides to do nothing, because she doesn't see what can be done. But when Apple threatens to remove SmartPoop from the Apple Store, Katia realizes that SmartPoop is then complicit in human trafficking, which is severely punishable by law.

- Horoscopes and pseudo-medicine (between Chapters 6 and 7 of SmartPoop 1.0): To enhance the effectiveness of targeted ads, SmartPoop sends highly personalized messages to its users in normal times, with the appearance of a horoscope. The ads reuse what SmartPoop tells its users to be even more effective.

- Employees' revolt (between Chapters 6 and 7 of SmartPoop 1.0): Tell how employees organized themselves to hold SmartPoop hostage, especially how they bypassed the company's communication channels to avoid being monitored. Talk about threats of legal action to convince other employees to cooperate.
