# 4. The sanitary leaks

It is an earthquake. Against all odds, on September 4, 2025, Jules Lartan, President of Bokistan, decides to pull his country out of COP 31, the international conference of the parties on measures to be taken to combat climate change[^cop]. Pale and visibly exhausted, he makes the following speech to the press.

[^cop]: The COP is an annual international conference to address environmental issues.  
[**Journal.** What is COP26? How the pivotal UN conference could avert global climate 'catastrophe'. CNN (2021).](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/23/world/what-is-cop26-glasgow-un-climate-conference-cmd-intl/index.html)

> It is a difficult decision. Climate change is a serious threat to the future of humanity. However, the demands of our international partners are unfairly disproportionate[^environmental-agreement]. Because of our economic success, too many of these partners consistently identify us as the sole cause of the current climate disruption, leading them to demand unreasonable sacrifices from Bokistan. Bokistanis are a people who do not deserve such judgments and contempt. I have therefore preferred to protect our people rather than succumb to the pseudo-moral tyranny of our international partners. We will continue to fight climate change. However, we will do so calmly and enthusiastically, and with our own sovereignty, not at the whim of our partners. Long live free Bokistan.

[^environmental-agreement]: [**Video.** Paris climate talks: Global problem, global deal. Nature video (2015).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5ywnmRkDok)  
[**Video.** Rich vs. Poor: Who Should Pay To Fix Climate Change? | Hot Mess (2018).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IssNa3f47mA)

Standing in front of her television, Celia Keita can't believe her ears. This investigative journalist has closely followed the debates leading up to COP 31. Although President Lartan did not play a leading role, he seemed far from reluctant to negotiate to combat climate change. After all, his own presidential campaign emphasized family values and the importance of preparing the future of the next generations by fighting climate change. Moreover, his anti-abortion and anti-euthanasia positions were justified by the importance of restoring Nature's rights[^left-right-divide]. How did he come to such a volte-face?

[^left-right-divide]: It is noteworthy that the political divide in Bokistan does not seem to coincide with that in the United States or in many developed countries, where anti-abortion and anti-euthanasia positions are usually correlated with conservative, but also with capitalist and climate change averse positions. It is interesting to ask whether there is a fundamental philosophical reason for these correlations, or whether it is contingent to the two-party political system that our single-member voting system leads us to.  
[**Video.** The Problems with First Past the Post Voting Explained. CGP Grey (2021).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo)

Even from a strategic standpoint, this spin doesn't seem to be warranted. In fact, in the days that follow, it is mostly confusion in President Lartan's party that reigns. The popularity of the President is decreasing, while it seemed to be heading towards a rebound in popularity in case of success of the COP 31. Something seems wrong[^rules-for-rulers].

[^rules-for-rulers]: Bruce Bueno de Mesquita's predictive models assume that politicians are primarily strategic, seeking to be and remain in power.  
[**Video.** The Rules for Rulers. CPG Grey (2016).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs)  
[**Book.** The Dictator's Handbook Why Bad Behavior is Almost Always Good Politics. Bruce Bueno de Mesquita & Alastair Smith. Public Affairs (2011).](https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/bruce-bueno-de-mesquita/the-dictators-handbook/9781610390453/)

### The Shitstorm

Celia decides to investigate the reasons for this volte-face. She interviews other COP 31 stakeholders. Some describe President Lartan as a difficult man, refusing to compromise and trying to impose his own ideas. Others, however, who have known him for a long time, say that his behavior has become increasingly difficult since his election, and especially in the last few months. Little by little, Celia identifies a date that is becoming more and more precise, after which President Lartan refused to compromise. Something seems to have happened at the end of July 2025, which then made President Lartan hinder the agreements of COP 31.

Celia then gathered her elements, and finally published an article in Bokistan's largest newspaper, *The Warden*. The article is titled "The Mysterious U-turn of President Lartan". The subtitle is even more suggestive: "How this convinced environmentalist ended up sabotaging the world's largest environmental initiative". The article strongly suggests the existence of secret agreements that changed President Lartan's positions.

However, this article is widely criticized. "Sensationalist", "partisan", "speculative", even "conspiratorial". Celia is accused of wanting to discredit an entire political party, and of wanting to stir up trouble in the Bokistani nation. Celia receives numerous insults on Twitter and Facebook, which then turn into daily harassment. Every day, hundreds of messages flood Celia with hateful names, ranging from "troll", "incompetent" and "attention whore", to personal attacks on her looks and origins[^declaration-brussels].

[^declaration-brussels]: In 2021, the Brussels Declaration was drafted to point out the harassment that many journalists face and to call for the defense of these journalists.  
[**Web.** The Brussels Declaration (2021).](https://brusselsdeclaration2021.com/fr/declaration)

Thousands of pornographic montages, with Celia's face and using *deepfake* technologies, are even abundantly produced[^deepfake-porn] and shared on social medias such as Reddit, accompanied by rape and death threats. Terrified, Celia files a complaint against her harassers. She also files a complaint against Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, which relay and promote hateful messages against her[^facebookfiles-algorithm]. However, while the social medias publicly express apologies and automatically block the insults sent against her, the police remain powerless against these anonymous accounts.

[^deepfake-porn]: Many women have been the target of such edits, like journalist Rana Ayyub. It is terrifying to realize that one of the great applications of automated image processing today is the cyber-stalking of women on the web, often with the aim of silencing them, especially when they want to reveal scandals.  
[**Journal.** I Was The Victim Of A Deepfake Porn Plot Intended To Silence Me. Rana Ayyub. The Huffington Post (2018).](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/deepfake-porn_uk_5bf2c126e4b0f32bd58ba316)  
[**Journal.** Opinion: The threat from deepfakes isn't hypothetical. Women feel it every day. The Washington Post (2021).](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/03/25/threat-deepfakes-isnt-hypothetical-women-feel-it-every-day/)

[^facebookfiles-algorithm]: In 2018, Facebook changed its news feed algorithm. This led to an increase in the virality of hateful and polarizing content, as this content led to more people reacting to it, and thus to more recommendations. The *Facebook files* show that this problem was raised by engineers, who discussed it with Facebook management. However, management largely ignored these issues, as the new algorithm strengthened user engagement on Facebook, and thus the profitability of Facebook's ad-selling business model.  
[**Podcast.** The Facebook Files, Part 4: The Outrage Algorithm. The Journal (2021).](https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/the-facebook-files-part-4-the-outrage-algorithm/e619fbb7-43b0-485b-877f-18a98ffa773f)

In shock, Celia locks herself in her home. She is then unable to work. She ends up uninstalling all social medias and making her accounts inaccessible. After one month, she decides to consult a psychiatrist, who helps her to find a good mood, a motivation to work and a capacity of concentration[^depression-instagram].

[^depression-instagram]: The following podcast tells a similar story, in the case of depression following obsessive Instagram use.  
[**Podcast.** The Facebook Files, Part 2: 'We Make Body Image Issues Worse'. The Journal (2021).](https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/the-facebook-files-part-2-we-make-body-image-issues-worse/c2c4d7ba-f261-4343-8d18-d4de177cf973)

Several months later, after reading a terrifying article about organized disinformation campaigns[^disinformation], Celia finally wonders if she was a victim. What if, in addition to producing and promoting disinformation via fake accounts[^fake-accounts], these campaigns also sought to silence certain information, by harassing journalists who were interested in it[^violence-against-journalists-women]? If this was their objective, these campaigns succeeded. It has now been 6 months since Celia suspended her investigation!

[^disinformation]: Organized disinformation is a voluntary act of manipulation of the information that will be received by the general public. On social medias, it can consist in producing false information, or in relaying it, but also in finding other means of action to silence the information that the organized disinformation does not want to see shared, or in polarizing a target group to create chaos.  
[**Video.** Who is Manipulating Facebook? - Smarter Every Day (2019).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY_NtO7SIrY)

[^fake-accounts]: The scale of fake accounts is colossal. To illustate, every year, Facebook removes around **6 billion fake accounts** from its platform, largely with algorithms. So at any given moment, despite Facebook's monumental efforts to ensure that every account is owned by a genuine human, it is almost certain that most accounts on Facebook are fake.  
[**Journal.** Facebook has shut down 5.4 billion fake accounts this year. CNN Business (2019).](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/13/tech/facebook-fake-accounts/index.html)  
[**Journal.** Meet the A.I. that helped Facebook remove billions of fake accounts. Fortune (2020).](https://fortune.com/2020/03/04/facebook-a-i-fake-accounts-disinformation/)

[^violence-against-journalists-women]: According to a 2020 UNESCO report, women journalists appear to be particularly vulnerable to such cyberbullying attacks.  
[**Paper.** Online violence Against Women Journalists: A Global Snapshot of Incidence and Impacts. Julie Posetti, Nermine Aboulez, Kalina Bontcheva, Jackie Harrison, and Silvio Waisbord. UNESCO (2021).](https://www.icfj.org/sites/default/files/2020-12/UNESCO%20Online%20Violence%20Against%20Women%20Journalists%20-%20A%20Global%20Snapshot%20Dec9pm.pdf)

In the end, it's the thought of being hacked by fake accounts that triggers Celia's pride and motivates her to resume her work as an investigative journalist. Celia restores her Twitter account. All the history of her conversations is then accessible. Celia then goes through the accounts that have harassed her. She realizes that a good proportion of these accounts were created recently, with profile pictures typical of the fictitious image face-generating website [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/)[^thispersondoesnotexist]. There is no longer any doubt. Celia was the target of a disinformation campaign.

[^thispersondoesnotexist]: The site [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) is a site that, upon each request, displays the image of a person who does not exist. The image is fabricated by a *generative adverarial neural network* (GAN), which basically tries to fabricate "hard to discern" images from its dataset of human photographs. The images on this website, recognizable by the fixed position of the eyes, are often used by fake accounts. However, technologies are advancing, making the detection of fake images likely impossible for well-crafted fake accounts.  
[**Video.** Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) - Computerphile (2017).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw9r8CL98N0)

### The Paul Gremoux case

Celia then noticed similarities between some of the accounts that harassed her, with, for example, misspellings in the same places. Some expressions seemed particularly strange. She searches for these expressions on Google. Google then references these phrases to a Tumblr account. Strangely, this account talks about mangas; not at all about politics or journalism. Curious, Celia nevertheless browses the Tumblr, and recognizes a similar writing style to that of an account that has been harassing her. Even more interestingly, Celia discovers that the Tumblr contains the first and last name of its author: a certain Paul Gremoux[^deanonymization].

[^deanonymization]: What Celia is doing here is a deanonymization work, with a very simple and manual approach. Deanonymization work can be much more sophisticated and powerful, for example by exploiting meta-data, such as the time of publication at different locations. Perhaps the most prominent example in history is the de-anonymization of Ross Ulbricht, the man behind the *Silk Road* black market of the dark web.  
[**Video.** The Silk Road: who was the real Dread Pirate Roberts? | Guardian Docs. the Guardian (2015).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FknwWMzc96A)  
Generally speaking, the theory of *differential privacy* insists that any pseudonymized publication actually offers no guarantees; to ensure the protection of sensitive data, much more rigorous methods are required.  
[**Video.** What is Privacy? Lê Nguyên Hoang. Wandida (2017).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jylloCa0iWA&list=PLie7a1OUTSagV55BZIvBckZJrDXQ9zl6i)

Now searching for this first and last name on Google, Celia discovers that they belong to a self employed carpenter, whose phone number is accessible. This could be the number of her stalker. Celia takes a deep breath and dials the number on her phone.

> Hello, hello, Paul Gremoux?

> Yes, it's me.

> Excellent, I'd like to ask you a few questions.

> Who is this?

> Before I tell you who I am, I'd really like to stress that I mean you no harm. I'm willing to protect your anonymity if you answer my questions and if you want to.

> Uh... okay.

> I'm Celia Keita, an investigative reporter for the newspaper *The Warden*. And once again, I insist on the fact that I wish to protect you, provided of course that you answer my questions.

> All right.

> Excellent. I know you have the Twitter account @rwqg[^rwqg]. My question is, are you working for a disinformation campaign? And if so, what led you to take this job?

[^rwqg]: This [account](https://twitter.com/rwqg), whose name was chosen here at random, is currently suspended on Twitter (in October 2021).

> Yes Ms. Keita, I am very sorry about that. I was contacted to harass you on Twitter[^information-paid]. All I had to do was write you three times a day with insults and threats. I'm really sorry. I did it very reluctantly. Please don't report me. I'm at high risk for a stroke, diagnosed by SmartPoop. And if my insurance finds out, I'll have bills I can't pay. I have two children to support. Please don't report me. I'm begging you.

[^information-paid]: This practice seems to be widespread, especially in authoritarian countries. It is estimated that, in China, 20 million Chinese are paid to produce disinformation, including 2 million in full-time.  
[**Journal.** A Different Kind of Army: The Militarization of China’s Internet Trolls. The Jamestown Foundation (2021).](https://jamestown.org/program/a-different-kind-of-army-the-militarization-of-chinas-internet-trolls/)  

> Thank you very much Mr. Gremoux. I would just like you to give me more information about the disinformation campaign that contacted you.

> I don't know them at all. They just sent me an email one day saying that they knew my SmartPoop data, so I was at risk for stroke. They threatened to tell my insurance, and offered to harass you in return. I can forward the email to you[^disinformation-dby]. But that's all I know. I'm sorry. Since I lost my job, I haven't been able to find another one. I tried to start my own business, but ROVID-19 destroyed my business. Please, I have two children to support.

[^disinformation-dby]: In 2021, French science YouTuber Leo Grasset, of the channel Dirty Biology, was contacted to produce misinformation about Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. He blew the whistle, sharing the email with journalists. The journalists were then able to trace it back to Russian sources.  
[**Video.** Comment une agence russe a essayé de m'utiliser. DirtyBiology (2021).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEuWVgh-d6Q)

> Thank you very much for your answers. I do not intend to pursue my complaints against you. I will keep your story secret. I promise you that. I would just ask you to forward this email to me at celia.keita@the-warden.com[^email-celia]. Thank you.

[^email-celia]: Do not use this email address for real! It has been inserted here only to make the story realistic.

> Thank you very much. And my apologies again.

### The inflitration

A few minutes later, Celia received the email forwarded by Paul. The original email, which contains the blackmail, was sent from the address foeqm@kinstova.com[^email-kinstova]. The domain name @kinstova.com then corresponds to an IP address[^ip], whose corresponding server is located in a foreign country, Kormica. This country is also well known for its oil industry. Could it be that the disinformation campaign was organized by one of these industries, to curb regulations against these industries? Could it be that this campaign also targeted President Lartan? What if the President was the object of a blackmail similar to that of Paul Gremoux?

[^email-kinstova]: Same remark as for Celia's email address.

[^ip]: The IP address is the identifier of your Internet connection, which allows a website you want to see to determine where to send that website. The IP address is provided to you by your Internet service provider, which might be Xfinity, Verizon or AT&T.  
[**Video.** IP Addresses and the Internet - Computerphile (2013).](9https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6bDA5FK6gs)

To find out, Celia tries to get close to Marie Routisse, the sister of the President's wife, who also happens to be a friend of a friend. Through her contact, Celia asks Marie for a coffee, to talk about an article on "the place of women in the professional world" she pretends to be writing. During the first contact, Celia does not try to get information directly from Mary. She is mainly looking to get her to let her guard down, by becoming friends with her[^social-engineering].

[^social-engineering]: This is sometimes referred to as *social engineering*. These are techniques to gain the trust of a target, either to get information from them, or to scam them. Social engineering is often considered to be the main vulnerability of computer systems.  
[**Video.** Social Engineering - How to Scam Your Way into Anything. Brian Brushwood. TEDxSanAntonio (2011).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY-lMkeZVuY)

After three or four encounters, Celia invites Marie to a bar this time, and pushes her to drink. At the end of the evening, she finally comes to the subject of interest to her.

> It's really hard to be a professional woman and have a family life at the same time. I'm sure if your sister wasn't trying to be a good mother, she'd be the president, right?

> Yeah, I'm not sure my sister is such a good mother...

> What do you mean?

> No, but you're a journalist. I shouldn't be telling you this.

> I promise I'll never talk about it publicly.

> I was told never to trust journalists.

> Marie, I invite you to contact all the people I have quoted in my articles. All of them have had a say in my articles, and if anyone wanted me to remove any information from my articles, I did.

> Yes, I know. My lawyers briefed me about you. But what I'm about to tell you is very big.

> Marie, I strongly suspect that President Lartan is being blackmailed because of this, which is making him betray his political convictions. I suspect this even more because I have sources who have been similarly blackmailed, probably by Kormic oil companies. These people were made to harass me daily against their will. And I believe that the source of their blackmail lies in the SmartPoop data. Marie, it is the management of climate change that is at stake, and therefore the future of the next generations. The future of your children, and their grandchildren[^climate-change-world].

[^climate-change-world]: The human origin of climate change and the major risks it poses to all humanity are now scientific consensus.  
[**Video.** 97% of Climate Scientists Really Do Agree. It's Okay To Be Smart (2018).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnnDOMyZjbE)

After a long silence, Mary confesses, "My sister had an abortion in June 2025". Celia's neurons are suddenly firing over all over the place, as all the pieces of a messy puzzle finally fall into place.

> This is it! Kormic Industries certainly managed to get their hands on your sister's SmartPoop data. And clearly, with the urine, it is possible to know if your sister is pregnant[^test-pregnancy], and if she stops being pregnant early! They must have then guessed that she had an abortion. Now, if this gets out, all of President Lartan's anti-abortion communication suddenly becomes discredited, and his career is over[^personal-data]. The Kormic industries certainly demanded that President Lartan get out of the COP 31 agreements, to avoid such a scandal. Wow! This is a huge deal!

[^test-pregnancy]: [**Video.** How do pregnancy tests work? - Tien Nguyen. TED-Ed (2015).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOfWTscU8YM)

[^personal-data]: What this example wonderfully demonstrates is how personal data is not so "personal" at all! Indeed, the revelation of this data often has major repercussions, not only on the person who "owns" this data (or let's say, to whom this data is associated, according to the law, or according to a platform that hosts this data), but also on many other people linked directly or indirectly to this data. This is the case here of President Lartan who, although he does not "own" his wife's "personal" data, is in fact as vulnerable to the publication of that data as his wife. Similarly, a photograph reveals information about everyone in the photograph, not just the person who owns the camera that took the photograph; and it may even reveal information about people not in the photograph (for example, if we know that on the day of the photograph A and B were hanging out, and if the photograph is a picture taken by A at a given location, then we can easily guess that B was probably at the given location as well). Similarly, an email written by A to B actually reveals information about B as well, and maybe about C if C is explicitly or implicitly discussed in the email. Even worse, an individual's DNA sequence actually reveals data about his entire biological family... but also about very distant family! In fact, rather than "personal" data (a term that reflects a very individualistic view of society, and that has a led to the very individualistic theory of differential privacy), it seems more appropriate to talk about "sensitive" data.  
[**Video.** Catching Criminals Using Their Relative's DNA. Veritasium (2021).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT18KJouHWg)

> Celia, I beg you, don't say it publicly. Even though I am shocked by what she did, I do not want my sister to be publicly humiliated and dragged through the mud. Such a personal humiliation would have a huge impact on her already fragile mental health, not to mention her children, and her entire family including my own children. Please, there are many lives at stake[^cyberbullying-depression].

[^cyberbullying-depression]: [**Paper.** Depression high among youth victims of school cyber bullying, NIH researchers report. NIH (2010).](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/depression-high-among-youth-victims-school-cyber-bullying-nih-researchers-report)

> Marie, you have my word. But I can't not disclose this either. Climate change is also threatening your children's lives. I will think about the best way forward, with your input. But we can't let Kormic industries manipulate the most powerful man in our country like this! I need you to help me arrange a meeting with the President.

### The President's Dilemma

A few days later, Celia received a call from President Lartan. The President invites her to talk in his presidential palace, safe from eavesdropping by anyone. That evening, Celia went to the palace and was received by the President.

> Thank you for your time and attention. I'll start by asking you: are you sure we can talk safely here, without the risk of being overheard or recorded?

> Yes, Ms. Keita, we can speak safely[^surveillance].

[^surveillance]: It is in fact now probably impossible, especially for a President, to *guarantee* that a discussion will not be wiretapped. Of course, phones are always listening, looking for an "OK Google" or "Hey Siri," and they can be hacked, as we saw in the *Pegasus* story (see footnote[^pegasus]). On top of that, a microphone can easily be hidden in a room. Even more surprisingly, sound can sometimes be reconstructed from a simple video, which analyzes the vibrations of light objects like a bag of chips.  
[Can You Recover Sound From Images? Veritasium (2019).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzB0L0mSCI)

> I guess that this is something that Marie probably already told you about. But I know that external entities are blackmailing you, because they know that your wife had a voluntary interruption of pregnancy. I know that they have asked you in particular to withdraw Bokistan from COP 31. I know how difficult the situation must be for you and your family. And I have promised Mary that I will not disclose anything without her consent. Nevertheless, I beg you to consider how a much of a vulnerability this blackmail is[^pegasus]. You are the most powerful man in Bokistan[^caviar-connection]. You are holding your whole country and the entire future of humanity hostage to protect a secret, which another journalist could discover and reveal at any moment.

[^pegasus]: The Pegasus case shows the extent of such espionage attacks on political leaders in the modern world. Pegasus is a *spyware*. In other words, it is an algorithm, that can be used to infect a target phone, and monitor everything that the phone does. Pegasus is developed by the NSO group in Israel, and is known to have been used by many intelligence services around the world to spy on many journalists, activists and political leaders.  
[**Video.** Pegasus: the spyware technology that threatens democracy. The Guardian (2021).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7H9uo3j5FQ)  
French President Emmanuel Macron appears to have been targeted by Moroccan services. Surprisingly, the French government has not indicted the Moroccan services, which may suggest that the Moroccan services do indeed have compromising information that allows them to blackmail this government.  
[**Journal.** Pegasus Project: Macron among world leaders selected as potential targets of NSO spyware. Amnesty International (2021).](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2021/07/world-leaders-potential-targets-of-nso-group-pegasus-spyware/)

[^caviar-connection]: Corruptions, potentially through blackmailing, has been revealed in the European Union.  
[**Journal.** Germany’s corruption scandals: How to limit authoritarian influence in the EU. European Council on Foreign Relations (2021).](https://ecfr.eu/article/germanys-corruption-scandals-how-to-limit-authoritarian-influence-in-the-eu/)

President Lartan remains still and silent.

> Mister President, I know it must be hard. I bet you are losing sleep over it. I bet you are living in a constant fear. I bet you already feel that you have lost control over the secret. But, Sir, be sure that it is only a matter of time before your story gets fully exposed. If I have cracked it, someone else eventually will. And it will be so much more hurtful to you, your wife and your family, if this comes from the political opposition, or from a less caring journalist. You have to come forward. For the sake of your family.

Upon hearing these words, President Lartan begins to cry.

> This is a nightmare. I love my wife, and I promised to always protect her. I promise you that I did not know about her pregnancy. I didn't find out about her abortion until they started blackmailing me. When I asked her if she had done it, she started crying, and begging me not to disclose it publicly. I promised her. And I never broke any promise I made to her. I love my wife more than anything, and the thought of hurting her terrifies me. I don't know what to do anymore.

> I understand. It must be a very difficult situation to live with.

Celia is silent as the President continues to cry.

> Mr. President, in the Spiderman movie, when asked to choose between his girlfriend and a student bus, Peter Parker chooses to save his girlfriend, and finds time to help the student bus as well[^dilemme-lartan]. But... But this is not a superhero movie. You can't save climate change and your wife's secret. You have to make a choice. The future of the next generation is at stake, Mr. President. I trust that you'll do what needs to be done.

[^dilemme-lartan]: This example is used by French YouTuber Mr. Phi in a video where he insists that the dilemma facing President Lartan is not a dilemma between two foundations of morality, such as utilitarianism versus deontology. It is in fact more of a dilemma between a global morality, which would favor the student bus, and an individual preference, which would favor loved ones like Peter Parker's girlfriend. Or put another way, in this situation, should we do what we prefer for ourselves, or what most people would prefer that we do?  
[**Video.** Encore plus utilitariste ? Monsieur Phi (2017).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2l8lxi-9aY)

With these words, Celia leaves President Lartan. The next day, the President speaks at a press conference, where he announces his resignation. He also reveals his blackmail and the cause of the blackmail, and affirms his unconditional support to his wife. Finally, he offers his deepest apologies, and begs all journalists and politicians to blame him, but not his wife.

The next day, the vice-president takes over Lartan's role. His first step is to reinstate Bokistan in the COP 31. Thanks to her investigative work, Celia has re-launched the world's largest climate initiative!

### Celia's ultimatum

However, Celia knows that what happened to President Lartan can now happen to anyone. As long as SmartPoop's data is vulnerable, the national security of the world's largest countries will be in great danger[^putin-calls], especially when power is as centralized as it is in Bokistan, where the President has great largesse. Thus, Celia's subject of investigation shifts from geopolitical affairs to SmartPoop's computer security. In particular, Celia now calls Katia Carpinski.

[^putin-calls]: Surprisingly, in 2020, Vladimir Putin called for an agreement to limit cyberattacks between different countries, even as Russia has been identified as the perpetrator of many of these attacks. This suggests that even the perpetrators of these attacks feel that these attacks may eventually destabilize everything, including themselves.  
[**Journal.** Putin says Russia and U.S. should agree not to meddle in each other's elections. Reuters (2020).](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-russia-usa-putin-idUKKCN26G1OM)  
For the security of all, it is undoubtedly urgent to establish an international convention which, like chemical, biological and autonomous weapons, would also prohibit cyber-attacks. After all, cyber attacks also endanger millions, even billions of lives throughout the world.  
[**Video.** The Future of War, and How It Affects YOU (Multi-Domain Operations) - Smarter Every Day 211 (2019).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOTYgcdNrXE)  
The same arguably holds for autonomous weapons.

> Hello Dr. Carpinski, this is Celia Keita, an investigative journalist of *The Warden*.

> Hello Ms. Keita, what can I do for you?

> I am calling because I have identified cases of blackmail from SmartPoop data. In particular, I have strong evidence that President Lartan's blackmail was based on detecting his wife's pregnancy from SmartPoop data. I would like to know more about the security of your data. Do you think a foreign industry could have hacked into your servers and retrieved data?

> It's impossible, says Katia while turning pale herself. Our infrastructure is based on the most advanced computer security technologies available.

> Can you check the data of the President's wife?

> Yes, as part of a security audit, it is possible. However, the general data protection regulation forbids me to share the results of the audit with you.

> I understand. I was just wondering. Do you perform external audits of the security of your algorithms?

> We have inclusion and diversity measures, which are designed to raise ethical issues with our products.

> Dr. Crapinski, you are not answering my question. Do you allow external entities to do this work?

> We have collaborations with many external auditing firms.

> Dr. Crapinski, don't make me repeat my question a third time. I am about to write an article on the security of your information system, and the absence of an external audit would be a very bad thing. I am willing to adapt my article if you actively work with me to clarify this matter. But be aware that your data is now a national security issue. And if I feel that you are not making efforts that are commensurate with this issue, in the interest of civil society, I will be forced to write an extremely critical article.

> Forgive me, Ms. Keita. No, the security of our IT system is not audited by an external entity.

> I would invite you to do so.

> Ms. Keita, I assure you that we do our best to protect our users and their data.

> If you were doing your best, you would allow external auditing of your algorithms.

> Yes, I would. I promise you that we will cooperate fully with you to identify and patch any potential vulnerabilities in our system.

> I'm glad to hear it. I will give you a month to provide me with a report on the security of your system, if possible with the endorsement of an external audit. And again, if you fail to do so, I will not be gentle.

> A month? That won't be nearly enough time.

> I know too well the ability of companies to procrastinate on ethical issues to give you more time. Please do all you can, to at least obtain a preliminary report. In a month, I'll judge if it's enough. And as you can guess, I will not be gentle.

> Thank you very much for the delay. I promise to do our best.

### SmartPoop is dangerous

Just after hanging up, Katia runs into Marc's office. She is obviously extremely concerned.

> How confident are you about the security of our data?

> I don't know, Katia, you're the computer expert among us.

> I just spoke with a journalist. She claims that the Lartan scandal started with a leak of the President's wife's SmartPoop data. She claims to have reliable sources, and it sounds serious to me. If it's true and it leaks, we're in for some very rough months.

> Wait, are you serious? We leaked President Lartan's wife's data?

> That's what she claims. Or rather, she claims that someone stole it from us.

> Is that possible?

> The most likely thing, I think, is that the President's wife did something stupid, and sent an email to Y thinking she was sending it to X, or that she was the victim of some other phishing or one-click scam. Or maybe her phone got hacked. There are so many imaginable vulnerabilities.

> Wait... But then, is the release of COP 31 related to this?

> I don't know. I haven't thought about it. But it's true that the journalist talked about blackmail.

> Katia, do you realize the geopolitical consequences of leaking our data?

> Yes, and if the journalist talks about it, it could do a lot of damage to SmartPoop. We risk losing the trust of our users. And if we lose the trust of our users, we will lose the trust of our investors. We may have to close down branches, lose market share and maybe worse.

> Katia, forget about SmartPoop for a moment. We're talking about the President of Bokistan, the guy who scuttled the COP 31!

> The journalist seems very reasonable though. We can try to show her a clean face, and make sure the article is not too violent for us.

> Katia, don't you realize that the national security of Bokistan is at stake? Actually, no, the security of all states in the world is at stake. It is the future of all humanity that is at risk!

> What do you mean?

> As long as SmartPoop data is not secured, this kind of manipulation of leaders will become the norm. It's terrifying.

Katia remains pensive. She is obviously still thinking about saving SmartPoop.

> And Katia, it's not just about blackmail, Marc continues. Imagine if a country managed to get SmartPoop data from another country. If it can anticipate an epidemic in the other country, it can interrupt the production chain of treatments against the epidemic, and thus cause a crisis in the other country. The security of medical data is very important. Not to mention the cost of insurance, discrimination against the sick and unexpected family outings. We really have to be careful about that.

> I see. But how do we protect ourselves?

> We need a monumental external audit of all our computer code.

> A full audit? This will cost us billions!

> That's a small price to pay for the future of humanity.

> No, but actually, no. Auditing all our code, it will cost even much, much more! I know that there is an Australian bank that paid 750 million dollars to redo the computer system[^cobol]. And that's a small bank, and their service is orders of magnitude simpler than SmartPoop. I think we're talking tens, if not hundreds of billions of dollars.

[^cobol]: [**Journal.** Banks scramble to fix old systems as IT 'cowboys' ride into sunset. Anna Irrera. Reuters (2017).](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-cobol/banks-scramble-to-fix-old-systems-as-it-cowboys-ride-into-sunset-idUSKBN17C0D8)

> Katia, we have no choice. If only to save SmartPoop...

### SmartPoop's audit

A month later, SmartPoop publishes an IT security report. This report announces and explains the development of a new personal data protection measure, based on homomorphic encryption. This cryptographic technology allows users to participate in the improvement of SmartPoop's algorithms, without SmartPoop ever having access to users' unencrypted data. Specifically, when the user collects data via their smartphone or toilet, this data is automatically encrypted, with a key that only the user has. Nevertheless, this encryption is done in such a way that SmartPoop will be able to learn from this data, even though SmartPoop will never be able to decrypt this data[^homomorphic-learning]. Thus, personal data is protected against SmartPoop itself, which prevents SmartPoop from being a vulnerability!

[^homomorphic-learning]: Note that the main reasonable applications today of homomorphic encryption to learning algorithms concern only the inference phase - not learning. In other words, in the case of SmartPoop, this homomorphic encryption allows to diagnose a user's excrement in a perfectly encrypted way; but it does not allow to exploit the user's data to improve the diagnostic algorithm.

However, recent work has turned to homomorphic learning. Unfortunately, homomorphic learning techniques do not allow today to perform the most efficient forms of learning in an efficient way.

The 400-page report also details the list of code libraries used by SmartPoop. Some libraries were developed by open source initiatives like Django, others by digital companies like Apple or Google, which can themself be at the origin of open source initiatives like Facebook with React, and others were written by SmartPoop itself. Crucially, each library used is a potential vulnerability.

The sum of these libraries now represents hundreds of millions of lines of code, and nothing guarantees that the instructions that are really executed by computers match the source code[^code-opensource]. Even worse, these libraries are used to define learning algorithms that have nearly millions of billions of parameters[^petabyte]. These parameters are adjusted daily based on the trillions of new daily data from the fecal activities of billions of SmartPoop users.

[^code-opensource]: Indeed, even if the libraries are open source and the code is accessible online, these libraries are rarely built internally ( which means transforming the written code to instructions for the computers) but are rather downloaded pre-built from external servers like the pypi one for example. Moreover, nothing says that, even if it is built internally, that the built instructions will exactly follow  the source code written by developers, it could have been "wrongly translated" by the compiler, unless the compiler is mathematically proven. Even worse, security researchers recently show that there exists invisible attacks, which means that in some cases, the source code that we read, on github for example, won't necessarily be the same that the compiler will read then translate to machine instructions.

> Our algorithms have reached the complexity of the human brain with its millions of billions of synapses connecting its hundreds of billions of neurons, the report says. This complexity is far beyond human understanding. For comparison, the report you are reading represents about one megabyte, or 100,000 lines of code, or one million parameters. To describe our code, it would take a thousand books; and to describe our machine learning algorithm, it would take a billion books[^Solomonoff-complexity]. No one can fully understand a thousand books; and no one can even skim a billion books. SmartPoop's security requires an astronomical amount of work.

[^Solomonoff-complexity]: In computer science, this is called *Solomonoff complexity* (also known as *algorithmic complexity* or *Kolmogorov complexity*): it is the shortest description of an algorithm capable of solving a given task, such as providing reliable medical diagnoses to the billions of SmartPoop users (the difficulty being to be reliable for all).

SmartPoop's report ends up with a call for help. It calls for monumental resources to audit, internally and especially externally, the algorithms it uses. It recognizes that this work will require much more transparency from the company, which is now publicly committed to it[^transparency-audit].

[^transparency-audit]: In her interview with *The Journal*, when asked by the reporter what intervention would be most urgent to make Facebook more beneficial to society, whistleblower Frances Haugen stresses the importance of *transparency*, especially given the enormous difficulty of moderating hate speech and misinformation produced by billions of accounts.  
[**Podcast.** The Facebook Files, Part 6: The Whistleblower. The Journal (2021).](https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/the-facebook-files-part-6-the-whistleblower/b311b3d8-b50a-425f-9eb7-12a9c4278acd)

> Massive investments in education are needed, not only for the general public, but also for professionals, including computer security experts, the report adds. At a minimum, hundreds of billions of dollars will be needed to achieve a satisfactory level of security, and even ten to a hundred times more. All governments and economic partners are called upon to support the SmartPoop audit. The health, welfare and safety of the entire world's population are at stake.

A copy of this report is sent to Celia, who takes the opportunity to thank and congratulate Katia for this initiative and for these very strong words. Celia then sends a version of the article she intends to publish to Katia. This article is entitled "Ecology now depends on computer security", with the subtitle "How a vulnerability in SmartPoop almost caused an environmental disaster[^information-environment]". While the article is overall very critical of SmartPoop's flaws, it nevertheless acknowledges SmartPoop's commitment to more transparency, and the massive investments for its internal and external audit. "Whether they like it or not, SmartPoop has become an IT security company[^security]," the article concludes.

[^information-environment]: In the following video, Lê Nguyên Hoang, one of the co-authors of this book, argues that information technologies already play a vital role for climate change. After all, any progress in combatting climate change surely requires spreading quality information on the topic, and debunking misinformation. Yet *information* technologies are at the heart of how information is spread, especially through recommendation algorithms.

[^security]: This is undoubtedly an important aspect in the growth of any movement or business. The more influential an entity becomes, the more likely it is to attract malicious groups, who will seek to exploit or manipulate the entity to achieve their ends. This is why it is often inappropriate to compare huge entities like Facebook to small, unknown and uninfluential initiatives. In particular, when an entity becomes huge, in order to remain *robustly* beneficial, it must not only invest in ethics, but also protect itself from the many internal and external malicious entities that will want to attack or manipulate it. This is one of the very big challenges of algorithmic and information ethics.
