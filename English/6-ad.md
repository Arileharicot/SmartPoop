# 6. The brown market

Frederic Partoli puts his foot down. Terribly frustrated, he walks off the field with his hand over his heart, which is beating very fast. He is taken directly to the hospital.

At the hospital, the doctor explains that Frederic is suffering from tachycardia[^tachycardia], caused by anemia[^anemia]. Frederic knows this. A few days ago, SmartPoop told him about his iron deficiency[^iron]. SmartPoop advised him to avoid all sports activities. But soccer was too tempting for Frederic. He preferred to play and risk it.

[^tachycardia]: A tachycardia occurs when the patient has an abnormally high heart rate.

[^anemia]: Anemia is a lack of hemoglobin, an important component of blood. This causes poor circulation of oxygen through the blood.

[^iron]: Iron is an important component of hemoglobin. In particular, it appears as Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions, within chemical subcomponents of hemoglobin called *hemes*. These ions help capture oxygen molecules, and transport them through the bloodstream.  
[**Web.** Hemoglobin and Functions of Iron. UC San Francisco.](https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/hemoglobin-and-functions-of-iron)

The doctor then recommends that he eat green lentils, sesame seeds, dark chocolate, kiwis, spinach, but also blood sausage, liver, or red meat. However, he specifies that red meat should be eaten in moderation. Finally, he adds that it is important to accompany this with vitamin C intake, via citrus fruits for example. Once again, this information is not really news to Frederic. SmartPoop made the same recommendations to him.

### The mystery of red meat

In the days that followed, Frédéric followed the doctor's and SmartPoop's advice, although he was apprehensive about black pudding, liver and red meat. Frederic is indeed sensitive to the animal cause, and cannot stand the idea of contributing to sophisticated animal torture[^animal-cause]. He is also very concerned about the disastrous consequences of animal exploitation on the environment[^beef] and biosecurity. After all, a significant proportion of scientists still believe that ROVID-19 probably arose from complex interactions between wild animals, livestock and humans[^biosecurity].

[^animal-cause]: It is estimated that several tens of billions of animals are killed each year to feed humans, most often in atrocious conditions.  
[**Web.** Number of animals slaughtered for meat, World, 1961 to 2018. Our World in Data (2018).](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/animals-slaughtered-for-meat)  
[**Video.** Why Meat is the Best Worst Thing in the World. Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell (2018).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxvQPzrg2Wg)  

[^beef]: Beef in particular, like all ruminants, emits enormous amounts of methane, which is a very important greenhouse gas. The exploitation of beef also requires enormous resources, especially in agricultural land to feed the beef, which is one of the main causes of deforestation.  
[**Video.** Beef is Bad for the Climate... But How Bad? | Hot Mess (2018).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD3sS743XHw)  
[**Video.** Why beef is the worst food for the climate. Vox (2020).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lrJYTsKdUM)

[^biosecurity]: Animal agriculture in particular uses a lot of antibiotics to protect its livestock. However, the abuse of antibiotics increases the risks of the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, which may then become untreatable with current medicine.

[**Video.** How can we solve the antibiotic resistance crisis? - Gerry Wright. TED-Ed (2020).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvhFeGEDFC8)

Nevertheless, notably because he has difficulty identifying with the image he has of the very virulent militant vegans, Frédéric struggles to identify with this movement, and to become fully vegetarian[^vegan-virulence]. He therefore seriously hesitates to resume a consumption of red meat that he had put on pause.

[^vegan-virulence]: [**Podcast.** Radically Normal: How Gay Rights Activists Changed The Minds Of Their Opponents. Hidden Brain (2019).](https://www.npr.org/2019/04/03/709567750/radically-normal-how-gay-rights-activists-changed-the-minds-of-their-opponents)

It is probably because he is asking himself existential questions about red meat consumption that Frederic perceives very distinctly a clear increase in meat ads in his social media news feeds, and on the various web pages he visits. Clearly, advertisers know that Frederic is being encouraged to eat meat. But then, how do they know, Frederick wonders?

Frederick checks all the messages he has sent since SmartPoop's announcement. None of them mention his anemia. Only the doctor was told. Could this doctor be selling the information? Impatient, Frédéric immediately dials his doctor's number.

> Hello doctor? Yes, I have a rather strange question to ask you. Have you told anyone about my anemia?

> Absolutely not. That would be violating medical secrecy[^medical-secret]. It would be extremely immoral, and contrary to the Hippocratic Oath[^hippocratic-oath].

[^medical-secret]: In many countries, doctors are bound by physician-patient privileges.  
[**Web.** Physician–patient privilege. Wikipedia (2021).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician%E2%80%93patient_privilege)

[^hippocratic-oath]: The Hippocratic Oath must be kept by every physician, and it states "[I will] impart precept, oral instruction, and all other instruction to my own sons, the sons of my teacher, and to indentured pupils who have taken the Healer’s oath, but to nobody else."  
[**Web.** Hippocratic Oath. Wikipedia (2021).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath)

> Did you enter this information into a computer?

> No. Since you told me that SmartPoop had already alerted you, I considered that this information was already in your medical record, and I had nothing new to contribute.

> Thank you doctor.

> Why all these questions?

> Because for the past few days, I have been receiving advertisements for red meat. I don't understand why.

> Strange indeed. But I can assure you that I have nothing to do with it.

### The Partoli experiment

As a good scientist, although usually confronted with psychological problems, Frédéric Partoli sets up a citizen science project[^citizen-science], where volunteers can share their SmartPoop data and the ads they receive on their phones and computers[^youtube-regrets]. Despite all his promotional efforts, especially on social medias, Frédéric is still struggling to recruit. Only seven people participate - all close friends!

[^citizen-science]: [**Video.** The Awesome Power of Citizen Science. SciShow (2016).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZwJzB-yMrU)

[^youtube-regrets]: In a similar genre, in 2020, the *Mozilla Foundation* launched a participatory program where volunteers could share their YouTube data to help researchers better understand YouTube's recommendation algorithm. Here again we have a case of the security-privacy dilemma. As long as YouTube's user data and algorithms remain private, it will be very difficult to understand the dynamics of user behavior on YouTube, and to take appropriate action to reduce cyber-bullying, hate speech and misinformation.  
[**Websites.** Mozilla Foundation (2021).](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/regrets-reporter/findings/)

Yet after 6 months, some triggers seem clear. Just after SmartPoop diagnosed Frederic's sister as overweight, she started receiving ads for athletic shoes. Just after Frederic's brother hurt his knee, he started receiving ads for electric scooters. Just after SmartPoop diagnosed Frederic's mother with vitamin A deficiency, she started receiving ads for carrot chips. And just after one of Frederic's friends became pregnant, she started receiving ads for strollers and diapers, while her husband started receiving ads for SUVs.

Frédéric wrote a scientific paper on these findings and submitted it to a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Unfortunately, the journal rejected Frédéric's paper because his sample size was too small. Nevertheless, in the meantime, the preprint version of the article, which Frédéric made available on medRxiv.org, was widely relayed on social medias, before being picked up by newspapers, such as *The Warden*. Science4Alpha even dedicated a video to it. Interestingly, this attracts many more volunteers. Thousands of people are now sharing their SmartPoop and advertising data with Frédéric, to better settle the existence of a reuse of SmartPoop data by advertisers.

This time, the signal is indisputable[^effect-size]. Very clearly, shortly after a SmartPoop diagnosis, the ads received by users were adjusted according to this diagnosis. Frederic rewrote his paper, and submitted it to the most prestigious scientific journal, Nature. The article was accepted and celebrated. The conclusion is implacable: advertisers have access to SmartPoop data.

### SmartPoop API

It only takes a short week for WAISO to contact Katia, and demand a new hearing for SmartPoop. This time, against all odds, when Katia shows up, she seems serene, confident and determined.

> Hello Doctor Crapinski. This is Professor Raul, psychologist. Is SmartPoop reselling SmartPoop data for advertising purposes?

> Professor Raul, since March 2027, we have indeed had an API, replies Katia.

> What is an API?

> Professor Raul, it's a kind of web page with information presented in a structured way to be downloaded by an algorithm. Our API allows our advertising clients to extract information about SmartPoop users. This API is access-protected: only our clients have access to it. For security reasons, we have very few customers who are large players that we trust not to openly publish this personal data. These customers can then call the API, with a SmartPoop user's contact information, and retrieve the user's health profile to optimize their ads. And every time a customer calls our API, they pay a few dollars, based on our estimation of the commercial value of the revealed profile.

> Has this API always existed? Why isn't it in SmartPoop's security audit reports?

> Professor Raul, this API has only been in production for 3 months. That's why it's not in last year's reports.

> Will it be in the next report?

> Professor Raul, no, it won't.

> Why is that?

> Professor Raul, thank you very much for this question. To answer it, I'm going to have to make some unusual disclosures, which will jeopardize my job, and which will very clearly make me enemies. But the short answer is that SmartPoop has suffered tremendously financially since our massive investments in software security. The cost of a full audit of our code is now estimated at a trillion dollars. Government grants were not enough for us. To pay for this audit, we did an IPO, which allowed us to raise a lot of money to fund our audits. However, this also attracted new investors, especially huge investment funds, which have a very strong business case logic in their culture[^useful-investment]. After all, these funds are financed by hundreds of millions of customers to whom they have promised a return on investment. They are literally designed to make money. And they've put more and more pressure on SmartPoop to make a lot more money. To keep my job and my influence, I was forced to listen to them. That's how the advertising API project was born.

[^useful-investment]: [**Journal.** The thorny truth about socially responsible investing. Vox (2021).](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22714761/esg-investing-divestment-fossil-fuels-climate-401k)

> Thank you for your candor. But this does not answer my question. Why won't the IPA be in the next report?

> Professor Raul, before I continue with my revelations, I would like to emphasize the risks I face. My revelations are going to make me serious enemies, who could succeed in making me suffer serious criminal sanctions, especially because I am about to violate professional secrecy[^nda]. Nevertheless, what is at stake seems to me above the law. Professor Raul, in order for the API project to be successful, you should know that our shareholders essentially forced us to invest heavily in a huge legal team. SmartPoop is now largely a legal firm[^equipes-legales]. Our lawyers have come up with perfectly legal schemes to keep the ad API out of our audits. Legal schemes that I personally find deeply immoral. Again, I have violated a legal non-disclosure agreement here. I am risking a lot with these revelations. Ladies and gentlemen, WAISO members, our lawyers are incredibly competent. They will drag me through the mud, and most likely win. I will most likely end up in jail[^nda-abuse].

[^nda]: The use of non-disclosure agreements (our *NDA*) seems to be widely abused in many industries.  
[**Journal.** I had to start over, alone and silenced': the fight to end NDA abuse. The Guardian (2021).](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/sep/21/i-had-to-start-over-alone-and-silenced-the-fight-to-end-nda-abuse)  

[^equipes-legales]: This comment refers to remarks by Google researcher Nicholas Carlini, which echo statements by other researchers on Twitter like Timnit Gebru. In an internal Google email, Carlini wrote, "When we as academics write that we have a 'concern' or find something 'worrisome' and a Google lawyer demands that we change it to sound nicer, it sounds a lot like Big Brother intervention."

A dead silence now fills the room. The members of WAISO are stunned. None of them suspected such revelations. SmartPoop, which they had celebrated as a model of transparency only 8 months ago, now seemed terribly corrupted by heightened profit motives, complex internal political games, and highly sophisticated legal maneuvers.

> Dr. Carpinski, Professor Raul asks, do you have any proof of what you are saying?

Upon hearing these words, Katia takes out her phone.

> Professor Raul, and ladies and gentlemen members of WAISO, in the last few weeks, I have compiled a lot of very compromising documents internally at SmartPoop, which I have transferred to several servers around the world, accessible via passwords. I have an email ready to send.

Katia presses the "send" button on her email application.

> That's it. You have just received the email in question, as well as a dozen journalists and science communicators whom I trust enough to prioritize the well-being of all of humanity. This email contains all the necessary information to download the compromising documents from the servers that host them. You will be able to verify, via the TLS[^tls] signatures in particular, that what you will read is both authentic and highly compromising. And you will quickly understand why the email I just sent you will lead to retaliation from SmartPoop. In the days to come, I will certainly not only be fired, but also sued[^facebook-haugen-lawsuit]; and I will probably end up in jail.

[^tls]: TLS signatures are used, especially via the HTTPS protocol used by the web, to authenticate that a given message is indeed coming from a recognized source. So when you go to https://twitter.com, your web browser receives a file that can only have been made by an entity with the private key that Twitter has. So if the page https://twitter.com says that the @le_science4all account wrote "long live math", with a TLS signature, then unless Twitter or the @le_science4All account was hacked, you have proof that @le_science4all did write what is displayed on the page posted by Twitter.

### The Externalities of Advertising

> Hello Dr. Crapinski. This is Professor Smith, PhD in public health. I want you to know that I admire your transparency even more. Dr. Frédéric Partoli's study shows that you have allowed advertisers to recommend abundantly the consumption of red meat and carrot chips. However, consumed in too large quantities, these products are in fact harmful to health. Do you regret these ads?

> Professor Smith, yes, I do. Well, not completely. We've thought a lot about ethically optimal dietary recommendations[^consequentialism]. And yes, there are healthier alternatives than red meat for anemia, and carrot chips for vitamin A deficiency. But users do not systematically follow our recommendations. For their health, in case of vitamin A deficiency, if they eat slightly too many carrot chips, it is still much better than never eating any carrots at all, which would happen for some users who hate carrots. If I regret these recommendations, it is not so much for the health of our users - although it can sometimes play a harmful role indeed.

[^consequentialism]: The notion of being "ethically optimal" may seem strange in a deontological framework; however, it is very natural in the consequentialist sense. It is indeed simply a matter of making recommendations that, given our state of knowledge, we believe have the best probable consequences for the health and well-being of the SmartPoop user and of society as a whole (especially in the case of a meat recommendation, which has externalities on the whole society).  
[**Video.** PHILOSOPHY - Ethics: Consequentialism. Wireless Philosophy (2015).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hACdhD_kes8)

> Why do you miss the ads?

> Professor Smith, after a few months, I realized that we, SmartPoop, have no control over which ads were actually recommended. And some of the ads have huge externalities on society. Every red meat or SUV ad is, indirectly but surely, increasing climate change and biosecurity risks[^google-ads-climate]. Even worse, I learned from talking to Frederic Partoli that pyramid scheme ads have been massively recommended to our SmartPoop users who suffer from anxiety. These pyramid schemes are causing horrible debt and suffering to millions of families[^pyramid-scheme]. And because we helped advertisers target vulnerable individuals, they have become tremendously effective. This is completely immoral. But this is not all. There are also a lot of advertisements of pseudo-medicine or naturopathic treatments that are very dubious, sometimes with curative claims against diseases like cancer, which can be very dangerous[^homicide-involuntary]. Worse still, there are the very politicized propagandas, which exploit the hatred towards certain minorities to radicalize their supporters, and go as far as calling for rebellion, or even war. 

[^google-ads-climate]: In October 2021, Google announced a new advertising policy, which now refuses to show ads that "contradict the well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change." Strangely, however, the justification given for this decision comes not from a corporate ethic, but from a response to the ethical concerns of the company's partners. Indeed, Google writes: "A growing number of our advertiser and publisher partners have raised concerns about ads that run alongside or promote inaccurate claims about climate change. Advertisers simply do not want their ads to appear next to this content. As for publishers and creators, they don't want ads promoting these claims to appear on their pages or in their videos."  
[**Web.** Updating our ads and monetization policies on climate change. Google Support (2021).](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11221321)

[^pyramid-scheme]: Pyramid schemes are forbidden in France. In promoting these pyramid schemes, it is unclear to the authors of this book whether a company that sells pyramid scheme advertisements could technically be judged for aiding and abetting pyramid selling.  
[**Paper.** Article L121-15 of the Consumer Code. Legifrance (2016).](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000032227258/)

[^homicide-involuntary]: As discussed in Chapter 2, a company selling alternative medicine advertisements would endanger not only the users, but also the users' relatives, and even the whole society when it comes to pandemics like ROVID-19.

> Calling for war?

> Ladies and gentlemen, members of WAISO, please realize what is at stake. At this rate, entire nations could hate each other to the point of coming to blows[^tensions]. Except that modern war technologies are not swords or guns; modern killer robots are now capable of causing monumental catastrophes[^spur]. Fleets of billions of killer drones, dropped from cargo planes, could exterminate an entire megalopolis in a matter of hours[^slaughterbot]. The idea that we are contributing via our API to the distribution of ads that promote such attacks, directly or indirectly, seems terrifying to me. That's why I decided to make these disclosures today, even if it means risking my own well-being and safety. The future of all humanity is at stake.

[^tensions]: There was of course the case of the Capitol riots in the United States, but the *facebook files* reveal disturbing abuses, which have led to physical violence and sometimes genocide, in many countries such as Myanmar, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, Yemen, Lebanon, Morocco, Algeria and Bolivia, among others. In particular, the violence in Myanmar and Ethiopia appears to have led to tens of thousands of deaths.

Another deafening silence reigns. Almost a minute passes as each member of WAISO realizes the urgency of confronting the ethics of advertising.

### The free market in information

> Hello Dr. Crapinski. I am Professor Abdoul, a researcher in geopolitics. If I understand correctly, your revelations today seek to go beyond the SmartPoop case. It is the whole industry of targeted advertising that you oppose.

> Professor Abdoul, actually, if you think about it, the problem is not so much that advertising is targeted. The biggest problem today is that most of the time, it costs the same to communicate a message of hate as it does to provide reliable health information. Clearly, one does not have the same social impact as the other! In fact, it's worse than that, on many platforms that maximize user retention, teaser ads, which make users stay, even cost less to run[^advertising-price]! This is ethical nonsense!

[^advertising-price]: During the 2016 US presidential elections, a Russian agency seems to have had comparable visibility to Trump and Clinton on social medias, investing a **thousand** times less money than these presidential candidates. All because their ads were very polarizing, making them very viral. On the Internet, some messages are much cheaper to spread massively than others; unfortunately, these messages are not the most beneficial to humanity.  
[**Journal.** Trump and Clinton spent $81M on US election Facebook ads, Russian agency $46K. Josh Constine. TechCrunch (2017).](https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/01/russian-facebook-ad-spend/)

> So if I understand correctly, you think that the existence of a market for ads without regulation is dangerous.

> Professor Abdoul, yes. And it's not just about ads. I think that the free market of *information* is very dangerous, and that it is something that is not recognized enough[^danger-reseaux-2]. It seems to me that it is far too commonly assumed that, by letting information flow unregulated and uncontrolled, the intelligence of crowds will bring about knowledge, empathy, and consensual decisions; that there will be some kind of invisible hand of the market of information that can be trusted[^invisible-hand]. To me, this is the most dangerous myth of the modern world. If we let it happen, clearly, those who will dominate the information market and govern the dominant beliefs and influential decisions will be those who have invested billions, even thousands of billions, to promote their products or ideologies, or those who have very easy-to-sell information content, such as addictive sensationalism, divisive scandals and misleading clickbait[^liberte-presse]. 

[^danger-reseaux-2]: [**Video.** Social medias are dangerous. Very dangerous. Science4All (2021).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5JRKUndWNk&list=PL8ovs-QtxcNxcwlsTF5O9NXtr3NAj_SVc&index=1)

[^invisible-hand]: [**Video.** Political theory - Adam Smith. The School of Life (2014).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejJRhn53X2M)

[^liberte-presse]: In France, a law of 1881 strongly regulates the freedom of the press. This one is therefore quite regulated, especially after an explosion of misinformation called "yellow journalism".    
[**Video.** My Video Went Viral. Here's Why. Veritasium (2019).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHsa9DqmId8)

> How confident are you in this claim?

> Extremely confident. I don't want to expose my sources, but I know many people working for big social media companies. They have clearly observed, again and again, that, by maximizing engagement, these companies are disproportionately amplifying outrage, even when it is motivated by disinformation, discrimination or hate[^outrage-algorithm]. These companies are now *hate dealers*. They are making money by selling hate.

[^outrage-algorithm]: The real world is here one step ahead of fiction! Thanks to the revelations of Frances Haugen, this information has become public. Indeed, the documents revealed by this Facebook whistleblower clearly show that Facebook changed its algorithms in 2018, to counter a decline in Facebook usage. Many employees then observed that this greatly amplified extreme messages. They concluded that the rise of authoritarianism around the world, and particularly in the Capitol Hill riots, was largely enabled, if not caused, by social media algorithms. But when they reported their findings to Facebook's leaders, no further action was taken by these leaders.  
[**Podcast.** The Facebook Files, Part 4: The Outrage Algorithm. The Journal (2021).](https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/the-facebook-files-part-4-the-outrage-algorithm/e619fbb7-43b0-485b-877f-18a98ffa773f)

> But aren't they a few bad apples? Or isn't it because they are monopolies?

> I fear that competition without regulation will only exacerbate the incentives to deal hate. I think that the bigger problem is a fundamental incentive misalignment, between the messages that are profitable to spread, and the messages that are *desirable* to spread, for the sake of all of humanity. Therefore, I strongly believe that, to sacralize the freedom of the free information market, in a context as competitive as it is today, is to sacrifice knowledge, nuance and benevolence[^liberty]. It amounts to abandonning the information battlefield to propaganda, hatred and inhumanity. And I think that this can only end badly for humanity. Very badly[^precipice].

[^liberty]: From a philosophical point of view, the notion of freedom is a complex one. But we can at least agree, to a first approximation, on tensions between freedom and security (for example, gun control aims to grant security by limiting freedom), and on the fact that "one person's freedom ends where another's begins".  

[^precipice]: Many authors believe that overpowering algorithms represent an existential threat to humanity.  
[**Book.** Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence. Max Tegmark. Knopf (2017).](https://futureoflife.org/background/life-3-0-being-human-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/)

A new silence invades the room. Obviously, every speech of Katia requires a time of informational digestion. Against all odds, the hearing, which was supposed to dwell on a SmartPoop scandal, has turned into a questioning of the entire information industry, which, all day long, collects, processes and disseminates certain information, and drowns others in a torrent of information.

### The regulation of information

> Hello Dr. Crapinski, this is Professor Wang, a researcher in machine learning. What can be done?

> Professor Wang, we can start by acknowledging that, in practice, there is no total freedom of information, and that this is certainly a good thing. Today, in many countries, hate speech, defamation and intentional lying are punishable by criminal penalties. No, we don't have the right to say everything. But more importantly, we shouldn't be allowed to say anything. After all, SmartPoop has been convicted several times, for saying too much, for making racist judgments, and for sharing information that should not have been said. The market of information is already regulated[^bad-ads].

[^bad-ads]: Google's algorithms censor nearly 100 "problematic" ads per... second!  
[**Journal.** Google killed 2.3 billion 'bad ads' in 2018, down 28% from 2017. Emil Protalinski. Venture Beat (2019).](https://venturebeat.com/2019/03/13/google-killed-2-3-billion-bad-ads-in-2018-down-28-from-2017/)

> But I guess you don't think it's regulated enough.

> Exactly, Professor Wang. I think it urgently needs to be much more regulated, if misinformation and hate are not to triumph.

> But, Dr. Crapinski, who should regulate information? How do we decide what should not be said?

> Professor Wang, the power to regulate information is perhaps the greatest power in the modern world. And I think we feel it instinctively when we talk about censorship; but we probably ignore it too often when it comes to recommendation. Yet when we control recommendation, we also control censorship. After all, to censor a message, it suffices to constantly recommend alternative messages[^mute-news]. Now, in a world of information abundance, the latter is clearly easier than the former. My point is that the issue is not so much censorship. The issue is how to manage the flow of information: to reduce the spread of certain messages and facilitate the spread of other content[^public-utility].

[^mute-news]: This is sometimes referred to as *mute news*. A *mute news* is an important information, but ignored by many, because it is buried in a sea of much less important information.

[^public-utility]: There would certainly be a lot to gain globally by promoting public-utility content.

> Very well, Dr. Crapinski. But you are not answering my question. Who should decide how to manage the flow of information?

> Professor Wang, today, de facto, content recommendation algorithms, especially on social medias, do it more than anyone else. It is now the moral responsibility of their owners to manage this flow in a fair and beneficial way. And if they take the measure of the monumental task that falls to them, I dare to hope that they will think about decentralizing the ethics and the audit of these very dangerous recommendation algorithms[^tournesol]. But, ladies and gentlemen of WAISO, if there is one thing I have learned in recent months, it is that the internal structures of gigantic multinational firms do not favor such reflection[^zhang]. No invisible hand will magically fix recommensation algorithms. You must intervene. This is why I urge you to do what is necessary to ensure that the management of the flow of information is not left to shareholders whose job is to prioritize profitability, and to legal teams whose job is to circumvent the law in order to achieve this as efficiently as possible. Dear members of WAISO, *you* have this responsibility. You must demand much more transparency from these companies[^transparency-shareholders]. And I hope that, like me, you will put the interests of civil society before your own[^haugen].

[^transparency-shareholders]: Interestingly, some shareholders are now also demanding more transparency from these companies, whose secretive maneuvers can be widely seen as a threat to the security of the company itself, especially over the long term.

### The SmartPoopGate

That same evening, Katia's confession made the front page of every newscast. "Digital earthquake", the presenter announces. "The CEO of SmartPoop lets go of her shareholders, revealing immoral maneuver", he adds. Meanwhile, Marc is a guest on Science4Alpha.

> Hello Marc. I remind that you are the co-founder of SmartPoop. Are you surprised by Katia's revelations?

> No, I'm not surprised. Katia and I have been preparing for this for several weeks. We knew that our company had engaged in immoral decisions, and we felt that we were losing our influence on future decisions. Knowing the monumental influence SmartPoop now has, and the staggering amount of harm these decisions can cause, Katia decided to legally sacrifice herself. I am incredibly proud of her courage and ethics. It's really fantastic. If all industry, legal, and state leaders had a thousandth of her courage and ethics, climate change probably might not be an issue anymore[^haugen-the-journal]. Congratulations Katia!

[^haugen-the-journal]: It seems a propos to highlight the monumental work done by whistleblower Frances Haugen to reveal in the most productive way possible the internal problems at Facebook, with the goal first and foremost of making the world a better place - not directly destroying Facebook.

> But these revelations, Marc, are they true?

> Unfortunately, Katia convinced me to keep my legal integrity, even if it meant sacrificing my moral integrity. It is important, she told me, that there are still dissenting voices within SmartPoop. So I am not at liberty to answer those questions. All I can tell you is that I have worked with Katia on a daily basis since the beginning of SmartPoop, and I have seen her work really hard to save millions, maybe even billions of lives since then. We haven't always agreed on everything. But, especially in the last few years, I have been impressed by her daily drive and unwavering desire to help as many people as possible. Congratulations Katia for all your work and your incredible intellectual honesty[^intellectual-honesty]!

[^intellectual-honesty]: Intellectual honesty is sometimes defined as the willingness to never engage in "self-bullshit". Put another way, it is about making the effort to constantly seek to be honest with ourselves, to understand the deep origin of our beliefs and preferences, and not to settle for incomplete or flawed explanations.

> What will happen now? Will Katia face dismissal? Will she be sued?

> Unfortunately, I am not at liberty to discuss these matters. Decisions will be made by our board of directors, and we'll see where we stand tomorrow. But I want to make sure that Katia's vision is realized, and that SmartPoop becomes a company that its users can really trust.

> Thank you Marc for your time and sincerity under these very complicated circumstances. Even if an interviewer is supposed to remain impartial, I would like to express my deep admiration for Katia. As you probably know, Katia, Marc and I have been working together since the beginning of SmartPoop, and if I had to choose between what's left of SmartPoop today and Katia, I wouldn't hesitate for a second, especially since my contract allows me to easily detach myself from SmartPoop. Katia, you have my unconditional support.
