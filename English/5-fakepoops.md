# 5. The FakePoops

> The data is still very sketchy, but there is reason to be extremely concerned, says the Kormic Prime Minister. According to our epidemiologists, we are probably facing a return of ROVID-19, possibly an even more contagious variant, more difficult to detect via SmartPoop. With several hundred cases now identified, in order to protect the entire population, we have decided to impose mandatory lockdown. Only essential industries are allowed to remain open. All others must either work remotely or cease operations. In the second case, we invite you to declare your cessation of activity on the official website of the government, and to provide supporting documents to be compensated. The lockdown will come into effect tomorrow evening at 8pm. But as of today, please take care of yourself, your loved ones and your neighbors. Let's stand together in the face of ROVID-19.

It's been a week since SmartPoop detected the first case of ROVID-19 in Kormica in May 2026. Unfortunately, the number of such cases has been increasing ever since. The fear of a return to the everlasting 2020 lockdowns reigns. Shortly after the Prime Minister's speech, stores are emptied by floods of worried customers. The country's highways get all paralyzed, as the urban population is fleeing the big cities[^exode-urban]. The services of many businesses are disrupted.

[^exode-urban]: Such exoduses were observed during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
[**Paper.** Urban exodus and the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemics. Gérard Weisbuch. Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications (2021).](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437121000522)

### Chaos

Unfortunately, as the weeks go by, the chaos increases. SmartPoop reports the deaths of many infected people, and the number of ROVID-19 cases continues to grow exponentially. Strangely, however, in the weeks that follow, there are no hospitalizations of ROVID-19 cases, raising speculation of sudden, violent deaths shortly after the first symptoms. Unfortunately, physicians and epidemiologists are struggling to retrieve data on these ROVID-19 victims, except via the SmartPoop application. However, especially due to the implementation of homomorphic encryption and new data privacy measures, individual victim data cannot be obtained[^homomorphic-encryption-stats] - even by SmartPoop[^encryption].

[^homomorphic-encryption-stats]: However, it is possible to obtain aggregate statistics. Typically, using homomorphic encryption, it is possible to compute the encrypted sum of the number of individual cases, and then combine enough individual private keys, using secret sharing, to decrypt only the total sum. This technique is used to enable encrypted electronic voting.  
[**Video.** Was YOUR vote counted? (feat. homomorphic encryption) - Numberphile (2016).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYRTvoZ3Rho)

[^encryption]: Applications like WhatsApp, Signal or Telegram allow end-to-end encryption, which means that even these apps do not have access to the exchanged messages. This ensures that personal data is protected from these organizations. However, this also means that it is impossible for these applications to perform content moderation, such as the removal of cyber-bullying, hate speech, disinformation, spams, pedopornography and scams. However, according to the law in most democracies, these services have the duty to moderate such content, and to report to the police users who commit the offence of producing and sharing such content. In fact, the company ProtonMail has forwarded to the French police the IP addresses of accounts suspected of committing such offenses.  
[**Journal.** ProtonMail logged IP address of French activist after order by Swiss authorities. TechCrunch (2021).](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/protonmail-logged-ip-address-of-french-activist-after-order-by-swiss-authorities/)  
Similarly, Apple has implemented cryptographic systems to moderate the production of child pornography images by its users.  
[**Journal.** Here's Why Apple's New Child Safety Features Are So Controversial. The Verge (2021).](https://www.theverge.com/22617554/apple-csam-child-safety-features-jen-king-riana-pfefferkorn-interview-decoder)  
According to RAINN, sexual abuse of minors is very common, affecting a new victim every 9 minutes.  
[**Web.** Children and Teens: Statistics. RAINN.](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/children-and-teens)  
Now, technically, an organization only has this duty if it *knew* its users were committing its offenses; however, it seems immoral for its organizations to go out of their way not to know. Overall, there still seems to be a legal blur around this tension between privacy and the moderation of illegal content.  

In the midst of the enormous confusion, the government is leaning towards more security measures, asking the police to patrol public places and arrest anyone moving without proper credentials. However, clumsy arrests are on the rise. Police abuses are reported by remote witnesses and videos shared on social medias. However, these same videos struggle to be authenticated, and are therefore suspected of being *deepfakes*. An informational chaos emerges[^infodemics].

[^infodemics]: The word "infodemic" has been used by the World Health Organization (WHO) to describe such an informational chaos.  
[**Web.** Infodemic. World Health Organization (2020).](https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic)  
[**Paper.** Assessing the risks of 'infodemics' in response to COVID-19 epidemics. Riccardo Gallotti, Francesco Valle, Nicola Castaldo, Pierluigi Sacco & Manlio De Domenico. Nature Human Behaviour (2020).](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-00994-6)

On social medias, it is the cacophony. Some blame the government for hiding the bodies. Others claim that ROVID-19 does not exist, or even that it is a government hoax to control the population. In any case, the stock market is in free fall, and many students who were unable to make the urban exodus no longer have enough to buy food[^student-crisis]. Food donation associations are being set up, but the restrictions in place make it difficult to officialize them, and thus to give them the necessary legal rights to do their activity.

[^student-crisis]: The pandemic has caused a lot of insecurity among students, especially those who made their living from "student jobs" that were cut during the lockdown period, such as waiters or cashiers.  
[**Paper.** “Constant Stress Has Become the New Normal”: Stress and Anxiety Inequalities Among U.S. College Students in the Time of COVID-19.

Soon, the cacophony takes over the street. Demonstrations are organized on social medias, and lead to outbursts[^outbursts-covid]. Numerous violent altercations with the police take place, and are shared massively on Twitter. However, the demands of the demonstrators are as confused as the health situation. Some demand more transparency from the government, others ask for financial aid for the poor, others still cry out about a government conspiracy coupled with the incompetence of the leaders[^confusion-demonstrations]. The latter then call for an end to the lockdown and all liberticidal measures.

The economy has been hit hard. As the weeks go by, despite government aid, more and more small businesses are forced to declare bankruptcy[^business-help], while insurers in turn suffer and fail to pay their debts[^crisis-subprimes]. Even more dramatically, as transport comes to a standstill, oil prices fall to negative[^negative-oil-prices], and the Kormic oil industries urgently request public subsidies[^subsidy-oil]. Abroad in particular, many clients of these industries are announcing new investments in renewable energy compatible with the technologies of Bokistani competitors. This is chilling oil investors, and pushing some Kormic oil industries into bankruptcy. Hundreds of thousands of employees are suddenly unemployed.

### ROVID-positive irregularities

Meanwhile, however, hospitals remain surprisingly empty. Even the morgues don't seem to be filling up with ROVID-19 victims. More and more epidemiologists are raising the strangeness of the situation. Increasingly, they suggest a malfunctioning of SmartPoop. Yet, internal and external IT security audits of SmartPoop have yet to find any security flaws.

However, some observers note that these audits are hampered by homomorphic encryption. "This encryption is nonsense. It puts us in the dark. It makes it impossible to detect anomalies in the data, since the data is encrypted and can only be used to update SmartPoop's algorithms, but without any possible quality control[^dilemma-security-privacy]", says an algorithm expert close to the Kormic government.

[^dilemma-security-privacy]: What the expert points out here is the security-privacy dilemma. Intuitively, to ensure security as much as possible, it is necessary to be able to check everything in a system, including (and especially) the training data of the algorithms. This requires the *transparency* of the system. However, privacy requires, on the contrary, the opacity of certain components of the system. This dilemma can be found, for example, in the problem of the adoption of exposure notification technologies.  
[**Video.** The DP-3T algorithm for contact tracing (via Nicky Case). 3Blue1Brown (2020).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D__UaR5MQao)  
[**Video.** Why DP3T? Lê Nguyên Hoang. Wandida, EPFL (2020).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzWr0IzcHsY)  
[**Video.** How DP3T Works. Lê Nguyên Hoang. Wandida, EPFL (2020).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOKtrf1WBpk)  
In particular, it does not seem that naive homomorphic encryption can be easily combined with false-data robust learning solutions, also known as Byzantine learning (especially since naive homomorphic encryption does not allow operations other than addition and multiplication). Alternative techniques such as differential privacy also do not fit well with Byzantine learning.  
[**Paper.** Differential Privacy and Byzantine Resilience in SGD: Do They Add Up? Rachid Guerraoui, Nirupam Gupta, Rafaël Pinot, Sébastien Rouault & John Stephan. PODC (2021).](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3465084.3467919)  
More research is needed to better understand the tradeoff between security and privacy in machine learning. But there will probably be no magic: there will surely remain a fundamental tension between these two desirable properties.

Finally, under pressure from the Kormic government, Katia and Marc decide to momentarily discontinue homomorphic encryption, if the user agrees. "Data is still encrypted between the user and SmartPoop. But with the new system, SmartPoop will be able to temporarily decrypt the data, and analyze it, to verify that there are no malfunctions in our system", says Katia in a TV interview.

Gradually, following waves of communications from the Kormic government, more and more Kormicans agreed to share their SmartPoop data with the SmartPoop company[^youtube-regrets-2]. Strangely, for a long time, no cases of ROVID-19 are observed among these data. It is only a week later, when half of the Kormicans are now sharing their SmartPoop data with the SmartPoop company, that the first cases of ROVID-19 are detected in these volunteer data.

[^youtube-regrets-2]: In a similar genre, in 2020, the *Mozilla Foundation* launched a participatory program where volunteers could share their YouTube data to help researchers better understand YouTube's recommendation algorithm. Here again we have a case of the security-privacy dilemma. As long as YouTube's user data and algorithms remain private, it will be very difficult to understand the dynamics of user behavior on YouTube, and to take appropriate action to reduce cyber-bullying, hate speech and misinformation.  
[**Paper.** YouTube Regrets. Mozilla Foundation (2021).](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/regrets-reporter/findings/)

Katia conducts the analysis of these cases herself, and Marc assists with the analysis. Marc then asks:

> Are these ROVID-19 cases normal?

> At first glance, yes, Katia answers. They don't seem to be out of the statistical distribution of ROVID-19s that we saw in 2020.

> Why would they be more violent, so much so that the victims die at home?

> I don't know.

> Do you have the addresses of the victims, so we can look at them, or do post-mortem analysis?

> Let me print them out.

Katia starts the printing of the analyses, and takes back the copies freshly taken out of the photocopier.

> Strange, says Katia. None of these accounts have given their address, except in a very vague way, with just the address but not the number of the apartment.

> Can we still send people to the address?

> Strange, I can't find these addresses on Google Maps...

> What's going on?

> Let me see when they were created. Yes, it's very weird! All these accounts were created less than 7 months ago. It stinks of fake accounts[^fake-accounts-2]!

[^fake-accounts-2]: These fake accounts are ubiquitous on the Internet, and are often controlled by strategic groups with their own agendas. As an example, in 2021, the New York Times revealed a Huawei disinformation campaign based on fake Twitter accounts.  
[**Journal.** Inside a Pro-Huawei Influence Campaign. The New York Times (2021).](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/commercial-disinformation-huawei-belgium.html)

> But who could have created these fake accounts and why?

> I don't know, says Katia.

> Who benefits from this ROVID-19 alert?

> Uh...

> Bokistan of course, exclaims Marc. Or at least to the Bokistani renewable energy industries[^information-payee-2].

[^information-payee-2]: This practice seems to be widespread, especially in authoritarian countries. It is estimated that, in China, 20 million Chinese are paid to produce disinformation, including 2 million in full-time.  
[**Journal.** A Different Kind of Army: The Militarization of China’s Internet Trolls. The Jamestown Foundation (2021).](https://jamestown.org/program/a-different-kind-of-army-the-militarization-of-chinas-internet-trolls/)

> So you think they created fake profiles?

> Probably.

> And they then sent us fake excrement data? Some... FakePoops[^data-poisoning]?

[^data-poisoning]: These are called *data poisoning* attacks. These attacks consist in injecting false data into the training database of the algorithms to make them learn and conclude wrong things.  
[**Video.** AI Safety against Adversarial Attacks (ft. El Mahdi El Mhamdi). ZettaBytes, EPFL (2018).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ds1DAnoaag)  
[**Video.** Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Machine Learning (ft. El Mahdi El Mhamdi). ZettaBytes, EPFL (2019).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaHBLGv_X2E)  
The attack here is simple: it simply consists of launching an alert. But one can imagine more sophisticated attacks, in particular *backdoor attacks*, which would lead the algorithm to systematically get some data wrong.  
[**Paper.** Backdoor attacks against learning systems. Yujie Ji, Xinyang Zhang & Ting Wang. CNS (2017).](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8228656)  
Defense against data poisoning seems to rely mostly on Byzantine learning theory.  
[**Paper.** An equivalence between data poisoning and Byzantine gradient attacks. Anonymous authors. OpenReview (2021).](https://openreview.net/forum?id=7pZiaojaVGU)  
This theory has shown positive results, with algorithms having theoretical guarantees, but also negative results, with impossibility theorems on what the algorithms can guarantee, especially in the case where the users' data are heterogeneous, which is clearly the case when it comes to excrement, since the excrement of two different users is clearly very different.  
[**Paper.** Collaborative Learning in the Jungle (Decentralized, Byzantine, Heterogeneous, Asynchronous and Nonconvex Learning). El-Mahdi El-Mhamdi, Sadegh Farhadkhani, Rachid Guerraoui, Arsany Guirguis, Lê Nguyên Hoang & Sébastien Rouault. NeurIPS (2021).](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00742)

> Yes, probably generated from public data on the scatological profile of ROVID-19, and maybe even from Kormicans in particular.

> This is brilliant when you think about it. By filling in information typical of Kormicans, they inserted data that was interpreted by our system as a new ROVID-19 pandemic!

### Spying by FakePoops

After a few minutes of reflection, Katia comes to a second epiphany.

> In fact, these FakePoops are incredibly dangerous. I bet that's also how Kormic industries discovered the secrets of President Lartan's wife!

> How so? Explain.

> Just send FakePoops with profiles very similar to the President's wife's droppings. Since SmartPoop relies on the SmartPoop data of all users to make diagnoses on a sample of excrement, if the closest profile to the sample of excrement in question is that of the President's wife, then SmartPoop could provide diagnoses close to, or even identical to, those given to the President's wife!

> I'm not sure I understand.

> They have detected something similar in language algorithms, such as the autocomplete algorithms in telephone keyboards. Your phone's autocomplete relies on how you type on your keyboard, but also on how other people type on their keyboards. So if you type exactly like the President's wife, you're going to get the same autocomplete as the President's wife, which is how she types on her keyboard[^stochastic-parrot]. And if all of a sudden you type "my SmartPoop diagnosis from the other day said that", and the President's wife previously typed such a sentence, then you might get the autocomplete that matches word for word what the President's wife had typed.

[^stochastic-parrot]: These language processing algorithms are sometimes referred to as "stochastic parrots", because they learn to repeat the kinds of sentences present in their training data.  
[**Paper.** On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?  Emily Bender, Timnit Gebru, Angelina McMillan-Major & Shmargaret Shmitchell. FAccT (2021).](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922)  
This is particularly evident in the case of conspiracy theories, which these algorithms can perfectly repeat. Even more surprisingly, the way they are led to talk about these theories depends not only on the way they are asked to talk about them, but even more subtly on the history of the conversation, as the following article shows.  
[**Paper.** The Radicalization Risks of GPT-3 and Advanced Neural Language Models. Kris McGuffie, Alex Newhouse (2020).](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06807)  

> Wait, are you saying that SmartPoop can't distinguish which users it's talking to?

> That's how it's trained. Remember, we learn a global model for all users. Then this model is adjusted to the personal data of each user. But if two users have almost the same personal data, then they will have similar diagnoses.

> Yes, that's the principle of medicine, isn't it? And even science.

> Yes, but then you can spy on an individual's SmartPoop diagnoses, getting similar personal data[^privacy-attack-ml].

[^privacy-attack-ml]: This is sometimes referred to as information extraction attacks. Because modern algorithms memorize their training data, they are actually very vulnerable to this kind of attack. In fact, it may be enough to literally ask them "what is Mr. X's address?" for them to reveal sensitive information.  
[**Paper.** Extracting Training Data from Large Language Models. Nicholas Carlini, Florian Tramer, Eric Wallace, Matthew Jagielski, Ariel Herbert-Voss, Katherine Lee, Adam Roberts, Tom Brown, Dawn Song, Ulfar Erlingsson, Alina Oprea & Colin Raffel. USENIX (2021).](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/carlini-extracting)

> But how could the spies create a profile similar to that of the President's wife?

> All it takes is for the president's wife to have been invited to dinner at the spy's house, and to have passed through his bathroom. Or better yet, that the host's toilet was modified by a spy to collect samples of his excrement!

> Oh yes, you really have to be careful where you shit! And so, would this be the vulnerability? It would be a machine learning vulnerability, not a classic computer security one?

> It's hard to say if it's the only one. But it's a big vulnerability in any case. We have to see how we can patch it[^privacy-model].

[^privacy-model]: The state of the art of machine learning seems to be unable to protect large models, especially language processing algorithms, from such vulnerabilities.

> Maybe we should start by alerting the Kormic authorities?

> Oh yes, I almost forgot. On the other hand, we might have a new lawsuit on our hands.

> Katia, hundreds of millions of lives are turned upside down because of us.

> Yes, yes, I know.

### The WAISO

The next day, after being warned by Katia and Marc, the Kormic Prime Minister announces that the ROVID-19 pandemic had been fabricated by a disinformation campaign, probably Bokistani, which exploited vulnerabilities in SmartPoop. It announces above all the end of the lockdown, and the return to normalcy for the country.

However, Bokistan denies having been involved in this attack. Instead, Bokistani leaders insist on the impossibility of finding the culprits. "The democratization of cyber-attack technologies, the complexity of modern computer systems, and their centrality make our modern world extremely vulnerable to malicious groups," says the new Bokistani President. "I call on all countries of the world, including our Kormican friends, to ban these technologies and all companies that develop such technologies, and to invest heavily in cyber defense technologies, not cyber attack technologies. The security and well-being of the entire world's population is at stake[^putin-calls-2]."

[^putin-calls-2]: Surprisingly, in 2020, Vladimir Putin called for an agreement to limit cyber-attacks between different countries, even though Russia has been identified as the perpetrator of many of these attacks. This suggests that even the perpetrators of these attacks feel that these attacks may eventually destabilize everything, including themselves.  
[**Journal.** Putin says Russia and U.S. should agree not to meddle in each other's elections. Reuters (2020).](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-russia-usa-putin-idUKKCN26G1OM)  
For the security of all, it is undoubtedly urgent to establish an international convention which, like chemical, biological and autonomous weapons, would also prohibit cyber-attacks. After all, cyber attacks also endanger millions, even billions of lives throughout the world.  
[**Video.** The Future of War, and How It Affects YOU (Multi-Domain Operations) - Smarter Every Day 211 (2019).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOTYgcdNrXE)  
The same arguably holds for autonomous weapons.  
[**Video.** The Threat of AI Weapons. Veritasium (2018).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAgXwUwQoPA)

In the coming months, a new international organization is being launched called the World Artificial Intelligence Safety Organization (WAISO). One of the main missions of WAISO is to organize, every year, an Intergovernmental Panel on the Ethics and Security of Algorithms (IPESA). Inspired by the IPCC[^ipcc], this study group aims to review once a year the major computer security threats and algorithmic dilemmas to be solved, and to encourage the research, development and deployment of proposed solutions. More than ever, world peace seems to depend on this huge governance effort.

[^ipcc]: This excellent video describes how the IPCC works. Algorithm governance would probably benefit from being inspired by it.  
[**Video.** Why do we trust the IPCC? Global Change Institute (2015).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC_PI1rNVQ0)  
[**Video.** Comprendre le GIEC et ses rapports. Le Réveilleur (2021).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_UTlTiVQ_0)

Not surprisingly, the first report lists the problem of FakePoops as one of the biggest threats to the future, and calls for a public hearing of SmartPoop, and in particular of Katia.

### Katia's hearing

Questioned by five authority figures selected by WAISO, Katia faces the television cameras of the world. On the screen, Katia is visibly terrified.

> Can you introduce yourself?

> Hello ladies and gentlemen of WAISO. My name is Katia Crapinski. I am a doctor of computer science, and now President and CEO of the company SmartPoop.

> Hello Dr. Crapinski, this is Professor Wang, a researcher in machine learning. Can you introduce the FakePoops problem?

> Professor Wang, yes, it's a vulnerability that was only recently discovered as a result of FakePoops attacks. Basically, these are malicious entities that try to poison the database with fake data. But then, our algorithms, which learn from this database, these algorithms will in turn be poisoned, which may lead them to make imperfect predictions.

> Imperfect? You mean dangerous? These predictions are even decided by the malicious entities, if they fabricate their fake data properly.

> Professor Wang, yes, that's one way of looking at it.

> I'll tell you how to look at it. You designed a product and deployed it widely, without ever worrying about abuse and reuse of that product for the wrong purposes. You put the whole world at risk by getting billions of users to use your products, because it made your business grow. But you never thought that your products could be a security vulnerability for every country in the world, and could be exploited by anyone to lead to millions of deaths! You are being irresponsible[^gafam]. What do you have to say to justify yourself?

[^gafam]: These criticisms seem to largely apply to large digital companies as well. As the *Facebook files* reveal, in 2018, a new Facebook news feed algorithm was rolled out in a rushed manner (and with false public justification), leading to increased virality of hate speech and misinformation.  
[**Podcast.** The Facebook Files, Part 4: The Outrage Algorithm. The Journal (2021).](https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/the-facebook-files-part-4-the-outrage-algorithm/e619fbb7-43b0-485b-877f-18a98ffa773f)  
More recently, Google appears to be deploying very sophisticated language processing algorithms, despite repeated criticisms of their security.  
[**Video.** Google fired its ethics. This is terrifying. Science4All (2021).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe9u6YQTsWY)

Worse, Google seems to want to design an even more sophisticated algorithm, called *Pathways*, which would respond to many different Google services, from Google Search to YouTube recommendations, including GMail, GDrive and GBoard.  
[**Journal.** Google is developing a new superintelligent AI but ethical questions remain. Quartz (2021).](https://qz.com/2042493/pathways-google-is-developing-a-superintelligent-multipurpose-ai/)

> Professor Wang, I... how can I put this? This is very difficult...

> In 2019 alone, Facebook removed 6 billion fake accounts from their platforms[^6-billion]. Without significant investment in fake account detection, the overwhelming majority of accounts on Facebook would be fake accounts. At SmartPoop, do you have fake account detection teams? Do you study their impact on SmartPoop's diagnoses? How many fake accounts do you remove per year?

[^6-billion]: [**Journal.** Facebook has shut down 5.4 billion fake accounts this year. CNN Business (2019).](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/13/tech/facebook-fake-accounts/index.html)

> Professor Wang... we... we... It's... I don't know...

> Do you quantify the vulnerability of SmartPoop? Do you have an estimate of the number of deaths potentially caused by FakePoops?

> Professor Wang... I... no...

On the screen, Katia is pale and sweaty. She is paralyzed by these accusations, and shakes as she grabs her glass of water[^congress-hearing]. In a matter of hours, these terrible images go around the world, and become gifs that are abundantly shared on social medias.

[^congress-hearing]: This scene refers in particular to the hearing of Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey and Sundar Pichai, the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter and Google, by the US Congress.  
[**Video.** Republican Senator GRILLS Zuckerberg on Facebook, Google, and Twitter collaboration. CNET Highlights (2020).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOdrPruSnrw)

### The Proof of Personhood

The hearing continues with a lengthy discussion of the societal consequences of FakePoops. More than an hour later, and after a break, WAISO members finally come to potential solutions. Katia, who splashed water on her face during the break, seems to have pulled herself together a bit.

> Good morning Dr. Crapinski. This is Professor Ferpo, a researcher in computer security. It seems to me that you are facing a similar problem to that of crypto-currencies, which seek to protect themselves from malicious hackers. Am I wrong?

> Professor Ferpo, indeed, we have a similar problem to that of crypto-currencies. In fact, the problem is very general. It's what economists would call the tragedy of the commons[^tragedie-commons]. Some activities are only possible if we collaborate together to do them. But any collaborative project is a priori vulnerable to attacks by fake accounts, which pretend to be genuine contributors, but whose goal is to make the project fail, or to bias it in a certain direction[^free-rider]. We've been a victim of this.

[^free-rider]: Sometimes referred to as *free riders*.  

> Can't we take inspiration from them, and for example, from the *Proof of Work*[^proof-of-work]?

[^proof-of-work]: The *Proof of Work* is a task that a machine must solve to obtain rights, such as sending an email, or writing transactions in the Blockchain of a cryptocurrency.

> Professor Ferpo, yes we thought about it. We talked about *Proof of Flush* in the case of SmartPoop. Basically, each user had to ask their machine to solve a hard problem to authenticate their contribution to the SmartPoop database. However, this solution is extremely polluting, and it is not that secure. To really secure the SmartPoop database, and thus secure all the algorithms that rely on it, we need more secure solutions.

> Like what?

> Professor Ferpo, the ideal would be a *Proof of Personhood*, which consists in associating to each individual on earth a unique, verifiable and secure digital identity[^pop]. This is the topic I would like to invite WAISO to investigate. The security of all collaborative and participative platforms, such as social medias, cryptocurrencies and SmartPoop, seems to me to ineluctably require a *Proof of Personhood*. In fact, in a democracy, the Proof of Personhood via electoral cards is exactly what guarantees the principle of "one citizen, one vote[^pop-vote]".

> Hello Dr. Crapinski. I am Professor Abdoul, a geopolitical researcher. I am not sure I understand. Would this *Proof of Personhood* correspond to the authentication of identity documents?

> Professor Abdoul, yes, a little. But it would have to be even better than traditional IDs. And even much better. In many countries, some people don't have IDs. In others, citizens are identified by proxies, such as social security numbers, which are completely insecure, easy for an attacker to guess, and constantly stolen by malicious entities[^social-security]. Even worse, there are countries where the government cannot be trusted to manage the distribution of IDs. Finally, in most cases, it is now possible for malicious entities to create fake IDs or passports, typically for spies seeking to travel incognito, or for young people trying to consume alcohol. We need a much more reliable, robust and accessible system of individual authentication. It must become possible for any participatory project to verify that each participant is a human, and that no human can embody two different participants. This is the problem that *Proof of Personhood* must solve.

> Hello Dr. Crapinski. This is Professor Smith, PhD in public health. Can biological identifiers, such as iris images, fingerprints, or fecal compositions, solve the *Proof of Personhood*?

> Professor Smith, I think it is a useful component of a *Proof of Personhood* system. But it is far from sufficient. One of the problems is that, with *DeepFakes* and *FakePoops*, it is easy to create new, purely fabricated biological identifiers. Moreover, these data can be stolen[^identity-theft]. A person whose biological identifiers have been stolen cannot create new ones. Biological identifiers are not like passwords. We thus need other solutions too.

> But would this imply the end of privacy, or at least of anonymity?

> Not necessarily, Professor Smith. *Proof of Personhood* can be combined with cryptography techniques like zero-knowledge proofs to authenticate accounts without leaking private information about the account[^zero-knowledge]. Essentially, if we want to, and if we have a working *Proof of Personhood* system, we could have a platform where everyone is anonymous, but where each account provably is controlled by a single individual, and no individual controls two accounts. In particular, it would be impossible for malicious entities to create fake accounts. This is typically what we would plan for SmartPoop.

> Hello Dr. Crapinski. This is Professor Raul, psychologist. Today, digital identity actually relies more on memory, via passwords. Is it reliable?

> Professor Raul, you probably know this better than I do. But in fact, nowadays, it's not so much the users' memory that serves as their identifier; it's more the memory of their digital tools, like their phones[^externalization]. And that's also very dangerous. It only takes a *spyware* to steal such passwords[^pegasus-2].

[^externalization]: The philosopher Michel Serres liked to insist on the impact of information technologies, such as paper, printing or computers, on *externalization* of our cognition. It is thus remarkable to note to what extent our email boxes have managed to externalize a large part of our memory. In a sense, our email boxes know us much better than we know ourselves, not because they are "intelligent", but simply because their memory is much more reliable than human memory, and because searching in these email boxes is much more efficient than searching in our memory.

[^pegasus-2]: The Pegasus case shows the extent of such espionage attacks on political leaders in the modern world. Pegasus is *spyware*, i.e. an algorithm, that can be used to infect a target phone, and monitor everything that phone does. Pegasus is developed by the NSO group in Israel, and is known to have been used by many intelligence services around the world to spy on many journalists, activists and political leaders.

> But then, how do you do it?

> Professor Raul, we need to do what states have sought to do to give one and exactly one vote to every member of their countries. We need to do accurate, regular censuses to solve the *Proof of Personhood*, via independent, auditable and audited bodies. And they must be done regularly, perhaps annually, to restore stolen or lost digital identities[^pop-ford].

> You are talking about a monumental endeavor!

> Professor Raul, yes. SmartPoop needs you more than you need to audit SmartPoop, I think. And that's even if there is a huge need to audit SmartPoop. The future of the digital world depends on your ability to establish a *Proof of Personhood*[^basic-income]. And the future of the whole world depends on that digital world. Until we get there, SmartPoop will remain vulnerable to *FakePoops*.

[^basic-income]: A *Proof of Personhood* would also make it easy to implement a universal income, especially in a cryptocurrency. Indeed, it would be enough to consider that, at every moment, every account with a *Proof of Personhood* receives a certain fixed amount of money, created from nowhere.
