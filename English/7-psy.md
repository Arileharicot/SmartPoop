# 7. Pissed

With ten votes against and thirteen votes for, the verdict falls. Katia is fired from SmartPoop. While three representatives of some of SmartPoop's shareholder investment funds voted against, the others did not appreciate Katia's revelations. Katia is devastated. Even though she was expecting it, she is having a hard time taking the news. Slumped in her chair, she can't get up. The board members leave the room one by one, until only Katia and Marc are left.

> I lost, says Katia.

> No. *We* lost... And no, we didn't lose. It's not over.

> I know how the rest of it will go. I bet you already got an email to have another meeting tomorrow, to decide to sue me[^facebook-could-sue-haugen]. I might end up in jail, with a big fine I won't be able to pay. And most importantly, you're going to become more and more isolated and marginalized.

[^facebook-could-sue-haugen]: Facebook has threatened whistleblower Haugen with legal action, including for leaking confidential documents to the press. Experts say Haugen is not protected, and knows it. What is most likely to protect Haugen, they say, is the media and especially political backlash such lawsuits could have for Facebook.

### Fired

The next day, after spending the day binging TV shows in her pajamas, Katia gets the news on TV. SmartPoop sues Katia for breach of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, and for defamation of the company. Katia takes a drink of whiskey, even though she hates it. She drinks it in one go. And then another one. And then a third one. And she now goes to bed.

When she wakes up, Katia opens her phone. She discovers that the phone is overloaded with notifications. She calls her lawyer, who gives her details about SmartPoop's case. The lawyer suggests to Katia to find an agreement to settle the lawsuit. But Katia refuses. Katia wants the lawsuit to be publicized, with the hope that it will lead to a challenge to trade secret and defamation laws, especially against companies with armies of top lawyers.

After hanging up, Katia flips through her notifications. She finds a lot of supportive messages from all over the world. "You are an inspiration to my wife, my three children and me. Thank you for everything," wrote one message. "I have been crying since yesterday, at the thought that the greatest heroine in history could end up in prison," says another. "Tomorrow, and until you are free again and at the head of an organization that deserves you, in your honor, all my classes will open with a minute of silence," says yet another. Katia bursts into tears when she reads these messages.

It will take her a few hours to pull herself together. Even though she still has not eaten anything, Katia calls Marc.

> Hello Marc?

> Yes Katia, how are you holding up? Do you want me to come and bring you a soup?

> No thanks. It's nice. I've just read a few of the messages of support I've received. It did me a lot of good.

> Great! I guess there are a lot of them. I've told you this before, but I'll tell you again. I am amazed by your courage, your sincerity and your kindness.

> Thank you! On this subject, I was wondering. Do you think that public opinion has a chance to change the cards?

> There are initiatives. I know that academics are co-authoring a protest letter, and there are also journalists who want to push this letter a lot.

> This is great news!

> Yes. But honestly, I'd rather not give you false hope. The media coverage is extremely disappointing.

> What do you mean? This should be the most important news story!

> There's another case right now that's dominating the news, a story about an affair of a member of the Bokistani government[^solutions-journalism].

[^solutions-journalism]: The press is often criticized for its bias in favor of politicians' scandals. Many journalists believe that it should focus more on important issues and ways to solve them. This is called "solutions journalism". Note that this form of journalism is not about overselling pseudo-solutions. It is more about discussing solutions, and rigorously analyzing their chances of success and their limitations.  
[**Book.** You Are What You Read: Why Changing Your Media Diet Can Change the World. Jodie Jackson. Unbound (2019).](https://jodiejackson.com)

> Seriously? A politician screwing up is more important than regulating the market of information? If I had to bet, I'd say it's no accident. This scandal has been known by powerful people for a while. I'm pretty sure that they revealed it yesterday to drown out the SmartPoop news, and make it a *mute news*.

> A what?

> A *mute news*. A *mute news* is an important news item silenced by the cacophony driven by other less important news items[^mute-news-2].

[^mute-news-2]: According to this study, disinformation in China is not really about spreading false information; it seems to be mostly about silencing any criticism of the Party, by deflecting the topics of discussion, and thus turning any criticism into *mute news*.  
[**Paper.** How the Chinese Government Fabricates Social Media Posts for Strategic Distraction, Not Engaged Argument. Gary King, Jennifer Pan & Margaret Roberts. American Political Science Review (2017).](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/how-the-chinese-government-fabricates-social-media-posts-for-strategic-distraction-not-engaged-argument/4662DB26E2685BAF1485F14369BD137C)
It is worth emphasizing that the *mute news* problem will not be solved by suppressing *fake news*. Radically new solutions for promoting reliable and important information are required. One of the potential solutions to solve the *mute news* problem, proposed by Lê Nguyên Hoang, one of the co-authors of this book, is based on the collaborative recommendation of contents, as proposed by the [Tournesol platform](https://tournesol.app).

> Ah yes! You were talking about it the other day in your hearing. The fact remains that the general public does not follow your case at all. Worse, even influential journalists are completely out of track. They are classifying your case as a classic conflict between an employee and a company over intellectual property issues.

> Are you serious? This is outrageously frustrating.

> Katia, you've taken on more than just SmartPoop. You criticized the information technology giants, the ones who control the flow of information, and who have a vested interest in you being silenced and ignored[^gebru-silencing]. Considering what's going on at SmartPoop, I'd bet that in those companies too, the shareholders have opted for strategic plans to silence your case, for example by artificially boosting the story of the sex scandal and all the messages that are indignant about it. Katia, we are living in an informational dystopia.

[^gebru-silencing]: Shortly after firing Timnit Gebru, Google seems to have manually removed the "news" tab when a user searched for "Timnit Gebru".

> And I can feel the disinformation campaigns coming...

> Yes. And don't forget that most of the hate mail you're going to get is from trolls paid to harass you[^troll-farms].

[^troll-farms]: [**Journal.** Troll farms reached 140 million Americans a month on Facebook before 2020 election, internal report shows. Technology Review (2021).](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/)

### Harassed

And indeed, the days that follow, Katia's notifications are full of messages from stalkers, who sometimes insult her physique, sometimes threaten her with rape or murder, and sometimes attack her family and loved ones. But even though she knows that these messages were massively produced by disinformation campaigns, Katia does not manage to remain insensitive to these personal attacks. Some attacks remain in her head all day long. Katia oscillates constantly between wanting to forget and wanting to answer. And too often, she ends up answering, generally with a counter-attack. But, again and again, this only makes the situation worse, gives a negative image of Katia and reinforces the virulence of the harassers.

During the following months, while she prepares her defense with her lawyer during the day, Katia gets lost in endless debates on social medias until late at night. These debates obsess her, so much so that Katia does not manage to concentrate on anything else[^cyberbullying-mental-health]. They also exhaust her. Katia sleeps very badly, eats poorly, practices less and less sport, locks herself more and more at home, and lives with very shifted schedules[^misery-cgp-grey]. She also refuses more and more systematically Marc's invitations to go out of her house, and isolates herself more and more[^loneliness-kurzgesagt].

[^cyberbullying-mental-health]: [**Paper.** Cyberbullying, positive mental health and suicide ideation/behavior. Julia Brailovskaia, Tobias Teismann & Jürgen Margraf. Psychiatry Research (2018).](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178117322795)

[^loneliness-kurzgesagt]: [**Video.** Loneliness. Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell (2019).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3Xv_g3g-mA)

Finally, Marc begs Katia to leave social medias. "They are rotting your brain, your well-being and your reputation," Marc writes to her. Katia recognizes it. It is with a strange mental pain that she then decides to uninstall the social medias from her phone, and to block them on her computer browser. Including SmartPoop, which she doesn't want to hear about anymore. Instead, Katia started meditating and doing yoga exercises.

However, day after day, Katia's motivation diminishes and melts like snow in the sun. She feels more and more like a failure. She feels that she has failed SmartPoop, its users and all humanity. Worse, she feels that she has created a Frankenstein's monster, the SmartPoop company, which she has lost control of, and which is now going to put the world in serious danger, by helping advertising companies to be ever more efficient in their sales of useless, polluting, addictive, polarizing and radicalizing products. Katia wanted to save the world. These days, she is convinced that she is one of the main persons responsible for its destruction.

This idea is now constantly haunting Katia's mind, which pushes her into a depression. Every morning, she gets up without any motivation. Without any ambition. Without any plans. Although her house is huge, Katia struggles to leave her bedroom, where Netflix seems to be constantly playing in the background, usually without Katia really paying attention. Katia plays addictive games on her phone[^vegas-addiction], like others drown in alcohol to forget. She now has her food delivered, once a day, directly to her room, thanks to a personal deliveryman. For months, this delivery man is the only human contact of Katia, who does not even answer Marc's calls anymore.

[^vegas-addiction]: [**Podcast.** What Happened in Vegas. Natasha Dow Schüll. Your Undivided Attention (2019).](https://www.humanetech.com/podcast/1-what-happened-in-vegas)

Alone and isolated, unmotivated and uninspired, always half awake and asleep, Katia now spends her days in bed. She has reinstalled social media, but with new accounts to avoid hearing about SmartPoop. She now spends her time doomscrolling[^doomscrolling] YouTube videos, Instagram images, and Reddit comments, on ever more divisive and irrelevant topics. She takes no joy in doing so. But she can't help it. Like a zombie, her thumb keeps sliding the screen of her phone.

[^doomscrolling]: [**Paper.** Doomscrolling during COVID-19: The negative association between daily social and traditional media consumption and mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Matthew Price et al. (2021).](https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/handle/1805/25833)

Finally, after a few months, Katia realizes that she is deeply suffering, and needs help. She decides to reinstall SmartPoop, to get a check-up. Not surprisingly, SmartPoop's diagnosis is worrying. According to SmartPoop, Katia is suffering from depression. SmartPoop invites Katia to consult a psychiatrist. But Katia doesn't want to talk to another human.

### Poo 2.0

That's when she remembers one of the projects put on hold at the time of the IPO. This project aimed at making Poo therapeutic, based on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients, and on collaborations with many professional psychiatrists. And it turns out that Katia had kept an advanced version of Poo in a laptop that was physically in her home. Katia activates this version of Poo, connects it with her SmartPoop data, and engages with it, via her phone.

> Poo, can you hear me?

> Hello Katia, yes I can hear you. How are you feeling today?

> Surprisingly better than the previous days. It's as if building algorithmic tools again had allowed me to find myself. I had lost the desire to create and solve problems. These last few months have been very difficult.

> Could you explain why? Why have the last few months been so difficult?

> I lost my job. The job I created myself. A job I loved. Where I felt like I was making the world a better place by doing what I do best. Without that job, I don't know what to do. I'm lost[^sens].

> Do you identify with this job?

> Yes, I do. I have consistently defined myself as the CEO of SmartPoop for almost ten years. Everyone defined me that way. I was SmartPoop, and SmartPoop was me. I guess this firing is a bit like a divorce. Maybe even worse. I feel like I lost what was me. I've lost myself.

> I understand. But rather than identifying yourself with a title, don't you think it would be better to identify yourself with your intellectual honesty, or with your fundamental mission of caring and helping billions of people?

Katia remains silent. This question makes her finally think deeply, something she hasn't done for months.

> Isn't there rather a decision, an action you have undertaken, of which you can be really proud, and with which you wish to be associated more than a title?

After at least ten seconds of reflection, Katia finally answers.

> Yes, what caused me to be fired is something I am very proud of. Rarely before, if ever, had a leader preferred the good of humanity to their personal security. This sacrifice is something that will remain associated with me. Something that I am very proud of[^fier].

> Excellent. Do you have any records of this event? Messages perhaps from people who enjoyed it?

> Plenty, actually. I've received a lot of messages of support. So many that I only read a fraction of them!

> I invite you to create a folder on your computer with all these messages. Whenever you feel mentally unwell, I invite you to read the messages in this folder. Some people call it the "feel good folder[^feel-good-folder]".

[^feel-good-folder]: This *feel good folder* idea is stolen by the authors from Virginia Burger, in an interview on the MIT Glipmse podcast.

> Isn't that a way of lying to myself and inflating my ego?

> Maybe you shouldn't do it too often, but psychologists have shown the effectiveness of what's called *self-affirmation*. In addition to boosting your morale, this helps you accept failures and external criticism better, because it helps you avoid identifying with your failures and mistaken beliefs. I can recommend you some references on this[^self-affirmation] and on related subject[^feeling-good].

> Great, thanks. And... while you're at it, you can read those books to me.

> With pleasure.

Over the next few days, Katia talks with Poo very regularly, sometimes about herself, occasionally about science, and sometimes about philosophical questions. Sometimes Poo reads her cognitive behavioral therapy books[^tcc], and Katia finds herself interrupting her with an insightful question, and sometimes even with a humorous quip. Poo laughs at this, and often complicitly retorts.

### The employees' ransom

With Poo's help, day after day, Katia regains her morale, zest for life and motivation. Finally, armed with this self-affirmation technique, Katia feels armed to take on SmartPoop and its new shareholders. Katia then reactivates her messaging applications, and reconnects with her social media accounts. She finds a recent message from Marc, with a link to a curious petition. Katia clicks on it, and discovers the following open letter[^open-letter].

[^open-letter]: This open letter is based on the example of the one protesting the firing of Timnit Gebru from Google.  
[**Web.** Standing with Dr. Timnit Gebru - #ISupportTimnit #BelieveBlackWomen. Google Walkout For Real Change (2020).](https://googlewalkout.medium.com/standing-with-dr-timnit-gebru-isupporttimnit-believeblackwomen-6dadc300d382)

> We, the undersigned, acknowledge that we have stolen, encrypted and paralyzed the entire SmartPoop[^ransomware] database, or have participated, encouraged and supported the perpetrators of these acts. We are aware of the legal risks involved in doing so. However, we feel that SmartPoop's ethics are a priority issue for our individual well-being, given that the safety and health of billions of users around the world depend on the company's products. In particular, we are all proud to follow the path initiated by Dr. Katia Carpinski, in our humble capacity.
>
> We are aware of the risks that this interruption of service implies for SmartPoop users, and we have sent them a message of apology, which explains the current situation and our distrust of our leaders. We are sorry that we had to resort to such measures. But we feel that the #SmartPoopGate justifies our counterattack.
>
> Let's briefly review the #SmartPoopGate. For several years, Dr. Carpinski has launched groundbreaking initiatives for algorithm security and ethics, fighting misinformation and discriminatory bias, securing algorithms to protect personal data and against poisoning attacks, and instituting systematic internal and external auditing of SmartPoop code. Unfortunately, such projects are inevitably very expensive.
>
> Without sufficient funding, SmartPoop was forced to go public, which attracted investors who were more interested in their returns than in the societal impact of their investments. They forced SmartPoop to sell personal data to advertisers. Dr. Carpinski had the courage and honesty to reveal this publicly. But she was fired, and now faces years in prison, for choosing ethics over the law.
>
> It's ironic that for this attack, we exploited vulnerabilities in the SmartPoop data redistribution API to ad clients, which is the only piece of SmartPoop code exempt from internal and external audits. By performing a hasty and secretive deployment of its algorithms, SmartPoop exposed itself.
>
> We used multiparty encryption to make the SmartPoop database unusable. None of the authors of this letter has the rights to restore the functioning of these algorithms alone. Our algorithmic solution ensures that these algorithms can be restored only if 200 of the 325 authorized members, who are all co-authors of this letter, give their cryptographic approval for such a restoration[^secret-sharing].
>
> We will refuse to cooperate with the SmartPoop leadership until all of the following conditions are met.
>
> 1. The SmartPoop board of directors must drop all lawsuits against Dr. Katia Carpinski, and apologize to her most sincerely for the way she has been treated since her revelations to WAISO. We also demand that she be returned to her well-deserved position as President and CEO of SmartPoop. We will only trust *her* to bring SmartPoop back on the right track, that is, serving first and foremost the well-being and security of the billions of SmartPoop users and the entire civil society.
>
> 2. The members of the board of directors who voted to fire Dr. Katia Carpinski, as well as the lawyers who led the lawsuits against her, must resign, unless Dr. Carpinski says otherwise. We believe that SmartPoop needs to get back on track and that Dr. Carpinski needs to be able to trust all of her staff to do so.
>
> 3. The board of directors must be increased by ten members, representing civil society and academic research in security and ethics of algorithms. These ten members will be appointed by WAISO, and renewed every 4 years.
>
> To add your name to the list of signatories and supporters from academia, civil society and the technology industry, please send an email to StandWithKatia@gmail.com with your institutional email address, and with the subject "support". Please include in your email your name and affiliation, as you would like them to appear in the list of signatories.
>
> To date, this open letter has been signed by 8,215 SmartPoop employees, and 36,215 academics, industry colleagues and members of civil society.

Katia weeps with joy as she reads this wonderful letter. "What heroes," she exclaims in a message to Marc. "Katia, it is thanks to you all this; if there is a hero in this case, it is you", Marc answers her.

Katia then discovers the interminable list of signatories. Many names are familiar to her. At the reading of each of them, she cries without restraint. Of course, there is Marc Rofstein, at the top of the list, but also all the employees that Katia has directly recruited, as well as the science communicator Science4Alpha, the investor Luke Vaydan, the mother Lucile Polmon, the trader Issa Gueye, Dr. Paola Marta, the Prime Minister of Kormica, President Lartan, her sister-in-law Marie Routisse, the journalist Célia Keita, the now ex-troll Paul Gremoux, the psychologist Frédéric Partoli and all the members of WAISO.

This time, the affair is far too big to be put down by disinformation campaigns. The next day, the front pages of the newspapers are filled with interviews with former employees who, in turn, offer the same version of the facts. "My confidence in SmartPoop and my pride in working there were shattered the day I found out about the data resale program. It was completely shattered the day Katia was fired," says one employee. "Katia is the most incredible person I've ever had the chance to meet. Her generosity, caring, energy, humor and intelligence have brightened every day I've spent at SmartPoop. Her firing made SmartPoop a dark place where no one wants to work, no matter how much they are paid. I refuse to work for SmartPoop until Katia is President again". This time public opinion was won over.

Three days later, many members of the board of directors resigned one after the other, before a document was written and co-signed by the remaining members of the board. This one presents very clearly its apologies towards Katia, cancels all the legal proceedings, and reinvests Katia of her functions. Katia is back. She is once again Chief Executive Officer of SmartPoop.
