## Why this book?

*SmartPoop 1.0* aims to be a very realist science fiction,
whose goal is to raise awareness of the danger of algorithms and the challenges to make them [robustly beneficial](https://wiki.tournesol.app).

It tells the story of a tech start-up, *SmartPoop*, which produces automated poop analysis.
This allows for highly personalized medical diagnosis.
However, in each chapter, the deployment of *SmartPoop* leads to *unwanted side effects*,
whose medical and social consequences are usually tragic.
The co-founders of *SmartPoop*, who are the main characters,
must then take the responsibility of their technology,
accept the consequences,
and find solutions to make their products more secure and ethical.
